23:106	well , I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who *T*-1 had fell and \[ needed * to be , \+ \] you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined *-2 to a nursing home for a while E_S
193:23	But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us . E_S
567:29	Needless * to say , my sweaters have been hung *-1 in the closet for quite a while now . E_S
638:11	Well , I lived in Omaha for five , winters , E_S
677:27	Although , I must admit 0 I did look at my watch after about an hour . E_S
732:12	Anyway , it 's on from seven to nine , or something . E_S
956:13	I do n't , have a sense of threat *ICH*-1 in general from those sorts of things , E_S
1202:79	but if they 're going *-1 to offer these services , or these recorded message , everything , they ought *-2 to be stuck *-3 * working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer *-4 to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them . E_S
1212:6	I agree with you on that particular subject there . E_S
1314:64	but \[ we got \+ uh , we got \] to * talking about the , uh , uh , people coming to you at the front door . E_S
1434:20	I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman , E_S
1499:23	\[ and , \+ and \] she kept in touch like that , and basically , just worked out of her house . E_S
1583:8	and I look for more of that in the next generation . E_S
2067:56	and then basically since then what I 've done *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] * keep track of it through the checkbook E_S
2071:8	so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook \[ each , \+ with each \] paycheck , even thought it 's really still there , so that I can keep , uh , uh , good balance , a running total , yeah through the month , E_S
2187:33	when ever we get enough saved * *T*-1 we stick it in a C D for a while E_S
2311:59	\[ and , \+ and \] the last book , uh , matter of fact 0 I read *T*-1 was , AT AMERICA 'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht . E_S
2326:46	Um , every now and then I 'm loaned *-3 a tape 0 I can stick *T*-1 \[ in the , \+ uh , in the \] car cassette set on the way home * to make the drive more enjoyable , talking about , uh , better outlooks on things and the philosophy \[ of , \+ of \] Pat Hagerty and these kind of , uh , mind stimulating philosophy type . Which *T*-2 all , you know , betters yourself . E_S
2467:21	I kind of try *-1 to judge from day to day . E_S
2479:70	and \[ it 's just MUMBLEx , \+ it *EXP*-1 's just \] impossible * to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress . E_S
2837:11	so . * Had a lot of people out at work , you know , for fishing , \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ uh , and \] golfing , reasons and things like that . E_S
2909:34	It 's amazing to me E_S because I have only lived in Dallas for three years , E_S and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time . E_S
2936:35	Oh , \[ rea- , \+ \] where *ICH*-2 did you go to school in Indiana *T*-1 ? E_S
2960:9	and we lived in , uh , South Bend for \[ eighty , \+ eight \] years , and , uh , then moved to , uh , Tennessee actually . E_S
3367:6	They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that . E_S
3486:18	but I bet 0 you were out there with your bell bottomed pants , E_S
3751:14	and they come , go to church with us E_S
4425:53	and , I did n't realize that they \[ ha- , \+ \] were going *-1 to reach out to people from , all over the country . E_S
4526:22	and others of them , um , had an impact on the society around here . E_S
4727:42	and you know , what *T*-1 frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people *ICH*-2 out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry , you know , E_S
4794:14	And they 're still let *-1 out on the street after one or two years . E_S
4912:11	and then they go back to work on Monday . E_S
4926:8	And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester E_S
5001:18	My wife used *-1 to work for Frito Lay as a typist . E_S
5042:21	and he says how do you get that from there to the material *T*-1 . E_S
5425:34	I find it *EXP*-1 hard * to , uh , follow from one page to another . E_S
5703:62	I mean , \[ it was like \+ for me , it was like \] practically impossible * to get between like ninety and , ninety-nine percentile \[ on the , \+ on the \] verbal part . E_S
6219:129	But , uh , you know , \[ I was just , \+ as a matter of fact , I just , \] uh , celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and , uh , kind of started *-1 looking through \[ the , \+ the \] book because of that , you know , E_S
6241:99	and I suppose 0 \[ \[ if , \+ b- , \] \+ maybe \] \[ in , \+ in \] your instance , \[ if , \+ if \] you 're started *-1 with T I in your early to mid-twenties , and happen *-1 to stay with them until you 're sixty-five , then you 'll have a very good retirement plan . E_S
6435:48	so \[ you , \+ you \] can have an extra five days off and be paid *-1 for them at the time , you know , E_S
6662:6	he was in C C C during , uh , N_S
6850:37	and then they , um , you know , go and actually live in that country for \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , N_S
6923:21	They figure that , if they give you card , at no charge for a whole year that you will use it E_S
7270:18	Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty , E_S
7342:22	\[ I , \+ I \] lived in Abilene for a little while , and , uh , worked in the Abilene plant , E_S
7401:8	and that 's about it down here , E_S
7546:22	You know , maybe it just was n't possible at all in the first place , you know , like the no new taxes thing . E_S
7646:23	\[ do , \+ do \] you work for T I in any way ? E_S
7837:33	sometimes \[ when I , \+ if you \] go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun . E_S
8271:29	See I do that *-1 to make myself go to sleep at night . E_S
8931:49	and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that E_S
9111:77	and I can remember \[ very \+ \] \[ etched , \+ * etched \] clearly in my mind , uh , *-2 flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down \[ and , \+ and \] really being unbelieving at , what *T*-3 looked like a , uh , N_S
9154:36	But they said \[ that , \+ that \] it really caused so much smog *ICH*-2 over , uh , the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they could n't do the , uh , piloting , uh , you know , the helicopter trips and that sort of thing . Which *T*-1 would be horrible , because \[ the , \+ there 's \] nothing , E_S
9292:6	I lived in this area for about twenty-five years
9365:8	and it was , you know , in the seventies out here E_S
9599:20	I mean I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours . E_S
9829:47	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] ended up *-1 watching a lot of these things on , you know , repeats in the afternoons or something . E_S
10041:26	but last year I just figured 0 they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything , E_S
10320:29	\[ we , \+ uh , we 've \] gone through the same things with ours , E_S
10337:125	\[ And , \+ and then \] when we go to sleep *T*-2 at night , you know , it 's like my husband and I have *-3 to try *-4 to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us . E_S
10730:17	and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date E_S
10883:30	it *EXP*-1 must have been great * just being with him \[ on , \+ on \] a daily basis and seeing how he prepares \[ for his , \+ for his \] lines *T*-2 and all that stuff . E_S
10972:121	and then , you know , uh , \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] no real , you know , direct reason , I guess 0 *T*-1 , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] get into , uh , uh , a really good relationship for a while and then , you know , back and forth E_S
11398:8	And we had , uh , a write up in our paper *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 , uh , this last time at work about , um , N_S
11872:6	people get up in the morning in that neighborhood E_S
11881:61	I mean , I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and , uh , you know , N_S
12340:45	* seemed that every other time 0 a President *ICH*-2 tried *-1 to get support for an action like , uh , uh , President Carter and his thing with \[ the , \+ the \] hostage crisis *T*-3 , \[ and \+ \] he always did it through rhetoric . E_S
12409:66	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ what , \+ what \] do you do *T*-2 with the people that *T*-1 are over there in the mean time . E_S
12454:90	\[ \[ and the Israelis , \+ uh , and not the Israelis but \] \+ the Arabs \] all of a sudden \[ are , \+ uh , are \] cheering for Baker on his drive \[ for , \+ * to \] reconcile relations with the Israelis , E_S
12495:16	I think 0 that is \[ a , \+ a \] positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years , E_S
12535:67	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] looking forward to *-1 seeing what *T*-2 happens over there in the next couple of months , E_S
13015:7	I took them up here to Collectors \[ Rector- , \+ Records \] and was able *-1 to get a little money for them E_S
13231:91	\[ In , \+ in \] Israel , \[ the , \+ even the \] women \[ are , \+ are \] required *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] be in the military for a certain period of time . E_S
13342:25	but , when you have *-1 to send that back in the mail with your name on it , your salary information *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] just have a real hard time * doing that ,
13662:6	* Wonder about them in what way ? E_S
13749:59	Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , *-1 taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care *T*-2 . E_S
13998:6	We talked about this for a few minutes , E_S
14035:19	so I try *-1 to listen to the radio in the morning \[ and , \+ and \] try *-1 to catch one of the morning talk shows , E_S
14036:24	and then I usually end up *-1 flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening . E_S
14103:53	so , I guess 0 we have \[ the , \+ the \] same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not . E_S
14154:26	Uh , \[ i- , \+ I \] spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst , E_S
14193:25	Uh , here 's *T*-2 what *T*-1 went on in Asia over the past week , E_S
14228:26	Because , you know , we do n't listen to the radio at work at all . E_S
14457:22	Actually I think 0 we have talked about football for five minutes . E_S
14494:16	I think 0 I was into the Cardinals for a little bit E_S
14546:14	And now they 're sectioning it off \[ to \+ like \[ from the , \+ from one \] \] twenty yard line to the other one , E_S
14664:119	Well , see the problem \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , what *T*-1 happens is \[ as , \+ \] that \[ you 're , \+ uh , you know , as you \] go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ? E_S
14712:15	And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . E_S
14739:56	it 's like , in , uh , nineteen eighty-eight , nineteen eighty-nine , the local , state , and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America , E_S
14741:93	I mean it 's like , \[ compared to , \+ you know , compared to , \] weapons or stuff like that , I mean , you 're spending nothing \[ on , \+ on \] crime in the country itself . E_S
14794:22	\[ I was , \+ I was \] \[ at a , \+ at a \] party on Saturday , E_S
15060:44	and a lot of students from Baylor go \[ and , \+ and \] serve as missionaries during the summer . E_S
15096:8	And I lived with Dana in school . E_S
15160:16	* have *-1 to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything . E_S
15263:59	and I guess 0 \[ they , \+ they \] keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it . E_S
15298:14	Um , I 've talked about camping with someone . E_S
15311:8	And I talked to someone about \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] uh , education system . E_S
15314:8	And I talked to somebody about credit card usage . E_S
15374:16	I had *-1 to talk to someone about hobbies , E_S
15604:46	\[ \[ and , \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] she feel madly in love with this writer . E_S
15759:23	there was one guy that we tested *T*-1 for preemployment for drugs who *T*-2 absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines , E_S
16413:15	and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie *T*-1 , it would soak into the pie shell E_S
16841:18	Are you going *-1 to go to East Texas for that ? E_S
16884:21	and he 's going *-1 to testify for the State against her so he 'll have his sentence reduced *-2 . E_S
16926:22	I said that , I could believe in it in certain instances , but \[ I would be , \+ I 'd find \] it *EXP*-1 hard * to levy that against somebody . E_S
17091:30	gosh , \[ if , \+ if \] I read straight out of the Bible to her she 'd never understand any of it . E_S
17529:24	Well , I 'm trying *-1 to get back in shape for softball this spring . E_S
17638:7	I get into that \[ for , \+ for \] a little while and maybe go out , uh , on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile , E_S
18096:21	\[ I , \+ you \] read about it in the paper , every day , somebody who *T*-1 's done this , or that , something really horrible E_S
18125:90	The people who *T*-1 were there originally , \[ when they , \+ when they \] changed the laws *-2 to revoke the death penalty *T*-3 , \[ are still in there for , \+ are in prison , \] in quote , for life , \[ and , \+ and \] are now coming up for parole , E_S
18211:52	I know , 0 \[ in , \+ in \] the Dallas metroplex area , I do n't go out hardly if I do n't have *-1 to *?* at night by myself E_S
18388:23	and , uh , I never really , messed with anything , uh , gardening or anything like that until now , E_S
18791:7	I used it on , uh , some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased *-1 to leave it . E_S
19142:39	\[ They brought , \+ uh , the week after Christmas they left \] a plastic bag *ICH*-1 on everybody 's front doorknob with a little note on it saying , we 're trying something new next week only ,
19426:11	and I 'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic , E_S you know ,
20170:98	Well , uh , \[ my , \+ uh , my \] family is from , uh , Europe \[ from , \+ well , from \] England and Ireland and , uh , have been in this country for , oh , more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years , E_S
20193:18	So they had *-1 to wait , uh , you know , in , uh , certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted *-2 to come over . E_S
20428:24	so I 've had *-1 to really switch around from the E Z form to the , uh , N_S
20611:8	So she was at school out here ? E_S
20659:14	And then I have been in Human Resources for the last two years E_S
20761:38	Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S
20880:28	and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , E_S
21033:18	Um , now if I 'm ever home \[ during the , \+ during the \] day on a vacation day , I have *-1 to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW , \[ because I usually , \+ because \[ he 's just , \+ he 's \] \] one of my idles . E_S
21857:107	because , you know , um , everything \[ that he taught me *T*-3 , \+ you know , that my family taught me *T*-1 , \] which is very hard *-2 to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , I 'm sorry , you know . E_S
22038:6	He came to school up here , E_S
22073:15	and , what you see *T*-1 on the T V -s \[ from , \+ you know , in \] Washington and New York . N_S
22103:8	Does it spread out of the neighborhoods into \[ the more \+ the , \] uh , retired people 's community , E_S
22107:10	but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies , rape and , uh , car crime . E_S
22192:55	And they have also organized fun activities like gyms , * going to the beach , and * playing volleyball at the beach in the summer , E_S
22194:52	And it seems that * the younger 0 you can get them and get them involved *-1 with programs after school *-3 *T*-2 , you might keep them E_S
22302:49	I mean if the parents are n't supplying it , they 've got *-1 to get it from someone else from the schools , E_S
22430:31	\[ I , \+ I \] used *-1 to fish , uh , when I was real young *T*-2 , down in Galveston with my parents , E_S
22606:6	I was out there for a reason . E_S
22636:9	I would go from one side of the boat to the other , E_S
22958:104	and if you 're still capable of *-1 driving and doing those things , then you feel like , well , gee , \[ I 'm , \+ you know , I 'm \] isolating myself here for no reason at the moment . E_S
23009:9	I 've talked to my mother about that several times lately , E_S
23256:16	and we 're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out , you know . E_S
23371:14	But what do you do *T*-1 with them in the meantime ? E_S
23643:14	In fact , I 'm at work out at Lewisville . E_S
23843:25	\[ My grandparents , \+ my grandfather \] came to the United States through Argentina . E_S
23946:23	And then * just cover it and put it in the microwave for \[ just , \+ just \] \[ two , \+ say two \] minutes , check it after two minutes *-1 to see if the fish flakes . E_S
24149:60	\[ My parents , \+ my parents \] made a mistake \[ in , \+ uh , in \] *-1 sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years . E_S
24574:40	Uh , well , I think 0 all college players have *-1 to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season E_S
24625:47	I agree with that . E_S Because I know personally myself , 0 I 've been in the same job for three years , E_S
24800:13	and *-1 having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . E_S
24800:32	and *-1 having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . E_S
24810:23	Well , that was my experience * going through junior high up there E_S
24811:11	when I came down south for high school *T*-1 I was just repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced . E_S
24815:28	And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high E_S
24875:17	but if *-2 do n't work with them as a parent , I think 0 *T*-1 you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage . E_S
25598:35	and then \[ one , \+ one \] of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf . E_S
25693:24	\[ we \+ MUMBLEx , we \] have one down here in the summertime . E_S
25694:11	Uh , it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock , you know , because it does n't get dark until nine thirty or ten . E_S
25701:8	And we play in the summertime out here . E_S
25855:9	it was done *-1 for me after a while . E_S
25999:6	It 's up to fifty-five on the gold card . E_S
26087:30	Well , * \[ Having , \+ having \] been out of the credit game for some years now , I 've gotten used to *-1 either paying in cash or not getting it . E_S
26518:6	I went to \[ a , \+ a \] car show down here \[ about , \+ uh , about \] two weeks ago , E_S
26555:52	but * to go out and drive , uh , never has really \[ been , \+ had \] any appeal to me in that regard . E_S
26713:14	and , if you put them in public service right out of high school , then \[ that , \+ that \] postpones their college , for a year E_S
27029:17	and , uh , this kid comes to school with his lunch box E_S
27345:17	but certain religious groups do n't want their children in public schools because the influence . E_S
27359:23	and they got sued *-2 . Got taken *-2 to court by the school system . E_S
27751:9	and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess 0 *T*-1 for several years after I graduated from college \[ and , \+ and \] thereafter E_S but have since , uh , N_S
27940:64	\[ I just , \+ you know , I can just \] drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time 0 * to do that *T*-2 , E_S
28150:55	that 's what I 'm doing *T*-1 , is * working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the , uh , week and use those hours * to do . N_S
28164:13	So my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week , E_S
28219:16	I know 0 that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something *-1 to help , and even though we were both working the same number of hours , \[ and , \+ and \] doing things , I had *-2 to come in there specifically and say this needs *-3 to be done *-4 , E_S
28349:11	well , she 's usually in bed by this time , E_S
28517:29	But , uh , the way 0 things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs *T*-1 is just great . E_S
28694:25	And I could n't believe when I walked in the door on my first day *T*-3 and here 's *T*-2 the audit department of \[ this , \+ this \] huge holding company , *-1 sharing a H P Rugged Writer . E_S
28703:50	So how are you supposed *-1 to expect *-2 to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
28874:38	as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had *T*-1 in the field in a management position E_S
28948:8	and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one , because that 's when I go into labor MUMBLEx *T*-1 four and a half months E_S
28992:38	I said , you know , I 've got *-1 to put this in writing to me , \[ and \+ \] because until they put it in writing , I could n't get my insurance benefits E_S
29075:22	See I 'd want *-1 to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty . E_S
29144:41	\[ and , \+ and then \] you see that their education *ICH*-1 is below the norm throughout of all fifty states . E_S
29264:8	and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends . E_S
29285:8	and I read it on the way in to work \[ on the , \+ in a \] carpool . E_S
29297:37	so \[ I do n't , \+ we do n't \] normally talk about the news at lunch . E_S
29298:44	\[ I , \+ I \] find that I have *-1 to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend , simply because I used *-2 to get it during the week E_S
29430:133	but there was \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] big push *ICH*-1 with the local T V stations * to have little hot lines with counselors * \[ to , \+ to \] help parents learn how *-2 to talk about their war with their children *T*-3 . E_S
29834:26	or I do n't even want *-1 to get into it in the first place . E_S
29842:70	I started a project , it 's been over a year ago that I swore 0 I was going *-1 to finish *T*-2 for somebody for Christmas . E_S
30140:32	But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time *T*-1 N_S
30243:16	I think 0 we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject , E_S
30269:61	Well as a matter of fact \[ I 'm , \+ before we started this conversation I was \] working on my P C at home . E_S
30277:6	I work with one \[ on , \+ at \] work continually , you know , E_S
30327:6	We keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it . E_S
30470:18	She could n't imagine *-1 going through college without a computer . E_S
30646:29	and you 'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time , E_S
30939:30	\[ It was , \+ it was \] all done *-1 in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic . E_S
30973:26	But \[ he , \+ he \] gets involved *-1 in some sort of bad dealings with somebody E_S
30998:21	I do n't know if they have the , uh , original actors on that first one to that one . E_S
31072:18	And , uh , we 'll Talk to you on the next go around . E_S
31096:23	So you have n't really , uh , dealt with that in a sense . E_S
31303:8	And they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training . E_S
31304:24	And at that point , he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors . E_S
31323:20	Otherwise , he might have been driving trucks or framing houses , you know , from here to eternity . E_S
31343:59	Maybe adult literacy . Maybe , you know , composition writing . Maybe , you know , uh , * volunteering , you know , on a tutor line or though \[ the , \+ even through the \] elementary schools for help with homework E_S
31743:11	but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May . E_S
32066:6	Everything does real well here in the spring until about , oh , first part of June E_S
32379:23	I had a lawn service *-1 to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months , you know , until I retired E_S
32454:78	When the days start *-1 getting a little longer *T*-2 , you know , \[ you can , \+ I can \] start *-3 doing it in the evening after work . E_S
32531:11	I did n't go out there for about three days , you know , \[ because I , \+
33387:39	I think 0 I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to keep that in mind for my future because I hope *-3 \[ to have \+ to have \] lots of dinner parties Cause I like *-4 to N_S
33394:22	He 's going *-1 to be working for Chevron in Houston E_S
33410:55	I have *-1 to impress the boss and clients cause Um \[ I 'm in \+ I 'm in \] public relations in school E_S
33603:73	like this orthopedist said , he said 0 you 'd be surprised \[ how many basket- , \+ how many people \] *T*-1 come in here with things like that because they are active . E_S
33652:25	And when I came down *T*-1 I hit with my full weight on my foot , but on concrete . E_S
34153:32	well \[ we , \+ uh , we \] was living on a navy base down in Memphis E_S
34581:24	and \[ there were , \+ there were \] some definite , um , should I say *RNR*-1 , tense moments , with him in there . E_S
34705:22	I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both *T*-1 . E_S
34837:49	that , and plus , I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt . E_S
34942:74	I 've \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] gotten away from , uh , *-1 being a series watcher , having *-2 to keep up to date with , uh , N_S
35471:97	but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car , uh , uh , checked *-1 at , uh , an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong , because they do n't have any financial interest in it . E_S
35679:60	But strangely enough , \[ the best off- , \+ I mean , the best bargaining \] 0 I had made *T*-1 with a dealer on my car was also the same place 0 I got the best price trade in *T*-2 , E_S
35732:8	and they gave it to me for that price . E_S
35743:46	well , unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , I got the car off your lot for that price . E_S
35766:58	because I told him 0 there 's a place in Arlington that *T*-1 's going *-2 to give it to me for that price . E_S
35975:124	What I hear *T*-1 one time , I think 0 it was on Paul Harvey 's , uh , radio segment , that he said that if the money that *T*-2 goes into welfare each year was *-3 to be given *-4 directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars *T*-5 . E_S
36136:16	I mean , I talked with somebody else about that another time , E_S
36225:51	I remember , 0 the company 0 my dad worked for *T*-1 , the people there went on strike against the management . E_S
36240:48	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ and \] that 's really what *T*-1 happened to the steel industry in this country . E_S
36685:78	Um , did you have another , a big tent , \[ \[ like \+ uh , um , like a , \] \+ 0 *T*-1 looks like a \] sitting area type , you know , like a two room type MUMBLEx ? E_S
36719:19	because , uh , we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas , E_S
37112:21	I mean , um , we painted them back in the fifties and sixties \[ as , \+ as \] nonfeeling machine type people , E_S
37237:44	\[ I , \+ when my kids were real little *T*-1 , I \] was at home for a couple of different periods of time . E_S
37379:36	I mean , uh , you know , you ca n't live in Dallas without , you know , N_S
37391:15	so , uh , I lived in Kansas City for a couple years E_S
37393:6	I lived in Houston for two and a half years E_S
37528:9	Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time E_S
37581:148	so , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] not a great indication because there have been teams that *T*-1 have just , you know , come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring \[ crani- , \+ training \] and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season E_S
37956:56	\[ I , \+ maybe I 'm \] wrong , because I have n't , you know , been in that kind of environment for a long time , E_S
38154:25	\[ So , \+ but \] I 've been at it for , you know , five years , E_S
38276:35	but , you know , \[ he , \+ his \] was more *ICH*-1 for scientific stuff than for word processing , you know , E_S
38329:28	and they just wanted me to continue *-1 working for them at home *-2 doing other things , E_S
38423:9	I just deal with them on the telephone , E_S
38750:44	I think 0 the last novel \[ 0 I read *T*-2 \+ I read *T*-1 , \] I guess , in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year . E_S
38999:8	and I was over there at Easter , E_S
39807:6	You see them in football on T V once in awhile . E_S
39859:14	but I 've been pulling for , uh , Duke for about four years now E_S
39884:9	I was pulling for Kansas on the other side , E_S
39952:45	\[ They did n't have , \+ they did n't have \] *-1 to go through some tough games during the year E_S
40312:6	I put him in a day care center from the very beginning . E_S
40380:28	Well \[ he was in , \+ he was in \] the same center \[ for two years , \+ for the first two \] years , E_S
40433:21	Well , I got *-1 to stay home with my kids for the first ten years . E_S
40639:8	so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders , in the same area with no walls . E_S
40651:24	But , it was just like * going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able *-1 to get home at two thirty . E_S
40729:13	and , God he got up on this elephant all by himself E_S
40743:30	and I thought , I 'm going *-1 to end up on this elephant with him , you know , . E_S
41046:18	because a lot of them lived in like a group , you know , down one highway . E_S
41106:12	So , did people come like from out of town to the reunion E_S
41689:29	And , uh , to me I just would n't feel comfortable in that at work , E_S
41842:20	I mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants .
41989:21	And it said 0 they 're going to other neighborhoods from there , E_S
42001:36	I think 0 they said 0 forty-one *ICH*-2 had been shot *-1 out of one church in the last year . E_S
42006:10	but these people are on death row for like twenty years , you know . E_S
42157:32	Men *ICH*-1 breaking in , uh , to houses and taking , or a man , N_S \[ they , \+ they \] think 0 it 's the same person , taking , uh , little girls right straight out of their beds at night . And , \[ ku- , \+ \] you know , breaking in , obviously watching them in the house , because they 're breaking into the right window , you know , the little girl 's bedroom . And taking them out , putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards . E_S
42196:66	And he 's taken them \[ and , \+ and \] raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard . E_S
42388:24	so , if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years , * do n't sentence them to fifteen years ,
42427:28	And if you commit this crime , you will be in prison for the rest of your life . E_S
43045:32	\[ Did , \+ um , you 've \] been working on it for three years ? E_S
43225:56	but right now where we 're living *T*-1 we have the trees where their , uh , roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground *T*-2 . E_S
43572:16	Walt Disney 's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years . E_S
43604:8	And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time ,
43727:8	And I lived over in England for four years , E_S
44075:11	either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top E_S
44190:21	\[ we , \+ we \] fall out of , uh , agreements with certain leaders E_S
44388:8	Idi Amin was , you know , in power for so long . E_S
44680:33	Like \[ if I , \+ if I \] put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours , uh , because I was going out . She would , uh , break something or rip up the carpet or do something just * \[ \[ to , \+ uh , to , \] \+ to \] let me know that she was unhappy with what I did *T*-1 . E_S
44790:28	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] looking for another cat for them .
45090:44	Uh , and I do n't know that , uh , a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason . E_S
45531:65	and until we got the dog , um , it *EXP*-1 was real easy * \[ to , \+ to \] go to town for \[ three d- , \+ three day \] weekend or whatever , E_S
45659:16	And the cat 's just looking at me like , sorry . E_S
45909:21	because , you know , they gave away a lot of their drafts . For different people for , you know , other places . E_S
45981:13	Or either they 'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies . E_S
46067:8	and I lived \[ in , \+ uh , outside of \] Boston for five years E_S
46252:41	\[ And \+ \] with the , uh , people that *T*-1 are coming into the country from other countries , *-2 not knowing the language E_S
46318:6	He ran out to the store for a few minutes E_S
46356:53	the reasons that they 're doing it *T*-1 compared to the reason 0 someone else is in jail for it *T*-2 , you know , it 's like two different things . E_S
46471:68	But I was thinking boy , in Dallas , if somebody asked me if there were places 0 you would n't go *T*-1 by yourself at night , I 'd have *-2 to set them down for about five or ten minutes *-2 to list all the places out . E_S
47348:43	Well , I 'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up in Boston for a while , E_S
47360:17	I guess 0 they paired two women together on this call for a reason which *T*-1 is something 0 we can think about *T*-2 later E_S
47437:6	I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car E_S
47622:25	\[ I have a , \+ I had a \] friend *ICH*-1 in college from Strasbourg , E_S
47763:19	but the things that *T*-1 work in psychology other the years that they 've proven *T*-2 to work , they just come out of the BIBLE E_S
47864:14	and then we would go to a movie on Thursdays E_S
47904:8	and he 's like a little brother to me . E_S
47939:33	seem , when I was growing up *T*-1 my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high . E_S
47953:16	they got *-1 to stay at home by themselves E_S
48004:21	but I 'd like *-1 to stay at home with them until they get \[ in , \+ at least into \] kindergarten , where they 're at school from what , eight to three or something *T*-2 E_S
48004:83	but I 'd like *-1 to stay at home with them until they get \[ in , \+ at least into \] kindergarten , where they 're at school from what , eight to three or something *T*-2 E_S
48103:22	\[ and , \+ and \] we lived in a trailer for eighteen years . E_S
48122:12	though we 've had such a breakdown in the family structure , from the standpoint \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , church and school and everything along the way . E_S
48126:130	And that I think 0 *T*-3 has contributed much to , uh , the delinquency that *T*-2 works grant and the poor school results that we 're having *T*-1 . Uh , that the students ' , uh , parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the \[ very \+ very \] beginning E_S
48184:24	and then he would have *-1 to make decisions for himself along those same types \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , lines . So that , I think 0 he benefited from my experiences . E_S
48221:11	Um , I lived in Massachusetts for two years E_S
48313:6	We lived in New Hampshire at the time . E_S
48685:31	\[ You do run in- , \+ you do run into \] limitations on yours ? E_S
48844:91	uh , you know , \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-5 \] really irks me * to see so much effort put *-1 into * preventing someone being put *-2 to death by the State when they so callously and usually \[ so , \+ \] you know , without *-3 even thinking or without any concern , uh , you know , end somebody else 's life , and in a lot of cases several people 's lives *T*-6 . E_S
48888:140	You know , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] no kind of deterrent because \[ we , \+ we 've \] got literally hundreds of people on death row , \[ and , \+ and \] many of them who *T*-1 have been there *ICH*-2 for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row , E_S
48919:88	And \[ the , \+ uh , the \] guy , that they tried and convicted *T*-1 and sentenced *T*-1 him to death , you know , he 's been on death row for like eight years . E_S
49482:10	and the clutch went out on it toward the end , E_S
49502:16	So , I do n't feel comfortable in traffic with it . E_S
49670:11	Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself ? E_S
50088:27	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] went to Purdue University for a couple of years and , uh , really learned *-1 to hate Indianapolis while I was out there . E_S
50153:162	And , uh , \[ I just , \+ I \] heard a comment *ICH*-3 on the radio this morning that , uh , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] gets to a point where , uh , if enough people \[ are , \+ are \] going *-1 to be slaughtered *-2 over there over \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] internal problems , um , somebody may step in again *T*-4 . E_S
50200:41	\[ and it 's certainly , \+ and it 's certainly \] been going on over there for hundreds of years . E_S
50294:15	I mean * looking at it from \[ the Am- , \+ the American \] public 's standpoints , they do n't understand the Middle Easterners . E_S
50336:24	\[ I , \+ I \] was stationed *-1 \[ in , \+ in \] Turkey \[ for , \+ for \] a year and a half . E_S
50575:38	the only reason 0 I got it *T*-1 is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school E_S
50871:44	I 'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training *ICH*-2 that is *T*-1 for the future for those kids . E_S
51016:33	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 the government sells information *ICH*-1 to private companies about individuals or families . E_S
51296:6	They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks . E_S
51433:14	Um , she was referred *-1 to me by a couple of people E_S
51463:25	And , actually , I 've started *-1 working up there in the afternoons , too . E_S
51475:25	But , uh , I really enjoyed *-1 being with her up there . E_S
51496:25	\[ But , \+ but \] they still go through all their , uh , curriculum as usual . E_S
51527:52	and we questioned her about what she fed them *T*-4 and , um , what she did *T*-1 with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them *T*-2 , \[ how , \+ how \] her daughter was *T*-3 with the children when her daughter got home from school *T*-5 and , stuff like that . E_S
51694:25	and she 's the kind that *T*-1 goes for convenience over anything else . E_S
51921:51	\[ They 've , \+ um , they 've \] had police officers come in and talk to them about it . E_S
52021:11	I have n't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months , E_S
52454:26	and they pushed it back , to *-1 playing it in the theaters until like August , E_S
52586:34	and so it kind of loses its meaning , if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth . E_S
52612:23	He changes your heart * not to look upon a woman in lust . E_S
52693:23	\[ We were , \+ we went \] on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff , two years ago , E_S
52946:32	\[ you do n't , \+ you do n't \] sound like it to me . E_S
53202:56	And even at that , \[ it , \+ it \] was like the first time that I ventured , you know , out of the city by myself *T*-1 . E_S
53229:26	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] was with T I until January . E_S
53334:9	I 'll talk about anything to anybody . E_S
53797:6	He had just as much dirt *ICH*-1 on him as anybody else . E_S
53814:18	and they had *-1 to sit in there by themselves . E_S
53835:20	and , I mean , they looked like a closet *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 to me . You know , with a desk in it , \[ a \+ \] real small . E_S
53910:24	But I really do try *-1 to use positive , uh , reinforcement with them at home , also . E_S
53979:6	It 's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend . E_S
54175:18	but , I did n't really talk about that with her . E_S
54214:16	Oh , um , I talked to someone about San Antonio , E_S
54255:34	but when it comes to Palestinians *T*-1 , if they 're out in the street at night , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really looked on as odd . E_S
54718:84	\[ I , \+ I \] might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although \[ I wo- , \+ I would \] remember , I think 0 *T*-1 in , with him in it . E_S
55016:6	I worked in , uh , Missouri for a while E_S
55040:6	They make it to the playoffs it seems 0 *T*-1 for the last few years E_S
55093:6	They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside . E_S
55251:31	The team 0 I was with *T*-1 , we jumped in on the western tip \[ of , \+ of \] the island down on Point Salinas . E_S
55343:91	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little bit shocked to what the U S has done *T*-1 in terms of *-2 selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years . E_S
55530:22	It pushes you because you 're pushing against the water in itself . E_S
55551:8	But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because , I really jump a lot . E_S
55960:71	It might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because then \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] coming in contact with it . E_S
56036:9	they 've got , um , in most of the states around here I think , uh . N_S
56109:50	Especially when we have dwindling , uh , resources such as oil that *T*-1 's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf , \[ and , \+ and \] so forth *T*-2 . E_S
56301:11	and then you cook it for seven minutes on high . E_S
56317:8	and you microwave it on high for seven minutes , E_S
56330:8	And you cook it for another three minutes on high , you know , just mainly *-1 to melt the cheese and everything , and let all the seasoning melt into it . E_S
56639:42	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ in fact I \] was in Texas for a little while . E_S
56682:21	And , uh , we 're only going down there for the food , though . E_S
56816:18	and you had *-1 to vote for , you know , yes or no on each of them E_S
57026:10	but most people think of it as a right . E_S
57166:50	And , uh , you know , a lot of people like those that *T*-1 work in the legal department for \[ their , \+ the \] real , uh , higher ups , like \[ \[ the \+ the , lawy- , \] \+ the T I lawyers , \] and , uh , those that *T*-2 work for \[ the , \+ the \] higher executives , those secretaries . \[ They , \+ uh , they \] really dress up all the time . E_S
57186:15	But , uh , he goes to work in his blue jeans , t-shirt , and tennis shoes , E_S
57215:11	and he 'll be over there until July first *-1 setting up some kind of computers for them . E_S
57229:59	But , uh , he did n't carry any ties or anything because \[ he , \+ he \] just went over there with \[ the \+ that \] attitude , well if I do n't take it then they wo n't make me wear it . E_S
57323:62	uh , uh , a little simple \[ shell , \+ shell \] blouse , you know , that you can make *T*-1 for about , say ten dollars \[ \[ at , \+ you know , at , \] \+ at \] the most out of a decent fabric , boy , runs you like twenty something dollars in the store . E_S
57773:25	And , uh , boy that *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 was , uh , really a mess back under there \[ under the , \+ \] in that van . E_S
57801:25	And , uh , I had *-1 to struggle with that for a while *-1 to figure which belt *T*-2 goes where . E_S
58025:78	And \[ I think , \+ I guess , \] 0 \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war E_S
58225:27	And it *EXP*-1 's so easy * to convert from one set of units to another . E_S
58248:30	And the problem is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that E_S
58250:11	and * get used to it from scratch , E_S
58251:17	cause I still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters E_S
58276:21	Well , I mean , it 's more *ICH*-1 our fault than theirs at this point because \[ they , \+ they \] saw the light , um , E_S
58350:28	but they decided *-1 to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe , or the rest of continental Europe E_S
58600:14	and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you 're ready . E_S
58890:11	\[ I went to school at , \+ uh , well I went to school at \] West Virginia University , E_S
58890:39	\[ I went to school at , \+ uh , well I went to school at \] West Virginia University , E_S
59337:45	and , um , uh , see I 've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it *T*-1 .
59493:182	What *T*-1 is happening at least in this state N_S and I expect *-1 to see it in other states very soon , E_S legislation *ICH*-4 been introduced *-2 \[ as \+ \] that , if a citizen of the state , *-3 being , myself , has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course , I can carry a weapon *ICH*-1 on me at all times concealed or uncon- , unconcealed *T*-5 . E_S
59782:9	I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day E_S
59810:58	by then you \[ should \+ all should \] have a plan worked * where you can make it on your own without our help *T*-1 . E_S
59925:16	and it really did n't dawn on me until Sunday , E_S
60088:73	and one of his fish jumped out of the , um , gosh , what do you call *T*-1 it , fish tank . And fried itself , , on the radiator behind the dresser . E_S
60098:11	and then they found it fried on , , the radiator behind . E_S
60416:53	Oh , well , * let 's hope that \[ you , \+ you \] are n't employed *-1 by that craft for too long . E_S
60427:45	\[ Wh- , \+ what \] kind of time frame is it , uh , looking *T*-1 for the , uh , different shifts up there ? E_S
60473:39	\[ That , \+ uh , I \] hear 0 they 're hiring all over the place for that . E_S
60593:58	So , despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing \[ or , \+ or \] going for walks in the mountains , I ca n't seem *-1 to get into it right now . E_S
60695:25	\[ And , \+ and \] I 'm looking at it as a change . E_S
60699:11	And I 'm looking at it \[ as , \+ as \] an adventure . E_S
61323:6	We have him on film , you know , on the video camera . E_S
61386:13	and when he 's not right at the door in the morning *T*-1 I really worry that something 's happened to him , that \[ somebody , \+ he 's \] got in a fight or , you know , somebody 's hit him E_S
61692:12	I 'm actually working on a data base at home * just to keep track of things
61874:29	So what , N_S do you , uh , uh , work with a computers \[ a \+ \] at T I ? E_S
62306:14	and then we could talk a bit about , um , just quality of products in general , if \[ y- , \+ they 're \] better or worse like if they last longer or something like that . E_S
62370:16	we had *-1 to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey *-2 \[ to get , \+ to meet \] these people . E_S
62548:95	And I thought well , if I had , uh , \[ a nic- , \+ a nice \] little , um , tape recorder , you know , so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while . And then also so that \[ \[ I can , uh , uh , copy , uh , parts off , \+ I , \] \+ I do \] some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that 0 I can use *T*-1 someplace \[ so \+ \] I figured well this will be good . E_S
62558:69	so after that then \[ you could n't get a \+ , you could n't get a \] tape 0 * to play *T*-1 at the right speed in that side . E_S
62830:8	And they run for two months at a time . E_S
63149:23	And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to \[ the , \+ the \] recreation center and do it helps a lot . E_S
63291:9	we were living in Lubbock at the time , E_S
63407:44	You know , if you start *-1 talking about miles , they 'd look at you like , what . E_S
63412:47	and also I noticed 0 in Canada \[ they , \+ uh , you \] drop a quarter , fifty cents , whatever , in a coke machine up there , E_S
63426:27	and \[ she has , \+ they have had \] Americans down there for so long , you know , that they 're kind of into both systems , E_S
63977:23	if they 're going *-1 to go out of state for vacation that 's the time 0 * to go *T*-2 . E_S
63991:13	Nice * to get out of Texas for a while . E_S
64327:21	Uh , I had *-1 to go up to T I on business a couple years ago E_S
64345:6	they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles .
64400:21	It was interesting . Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way . E_S
64466:14	So I had never listened to it \[ bef- , \+ till \] then , E_S
64615:21	\[ I , \+ I \] lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore , E_S
64968:111	Well our daughter and son-in-law moved \[ up , \+ back up \] here . He 's from Texas , but course she 's from here , uh , about a year and a half ago , and had their house on the market down there , E_S
65360:27	\[ so . \+ And \] I have n't been back to Des Moines in a long time . E_S
65462:8	But I park for free up \[ at , \+ at \] Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free *T*-1 . E_S
65679:16	In other words , they 're in there for a purpose , E_S
65719:51	But see , we do n't even push the fact *ICH*-1 to the high school kids that there 's other means of education *ICH*-2 out there rather than college .
65725:47	why * not an apprentice out to \[ a , \+ a \] company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or , you know , just a technician *T*-1 ? E_S
65746:38	But they ca n't just bring somebody in without *-1 even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . E_S
65746:77	But they ca n't just bring somebody in without *-1 even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . E_S
65840:6	You threw that question *ICH*-1 on me about the deficit , E_S
66082:151	\[ it 's \+ \] bad because if \[ you , \+ you know , your \] bill is due on the fifteenth then \[ i- , \+ \] \[ \[ \[ \[ y- , \+ y- , \] \+ y- , \] \+ you- , \] \+ you 're \] not past due until the fifteenth of the next month . E_S
66268:37	what *T*-1 's amazing is 0 some of them have been on death row for a number of years . E_S
66280:81	here it 's , uh , to the point where they were letting prisoners go . Uh , commuting the sentences of those that *T*-1 were \[ in , \+ in \] jail for lesser crimes , in order *-2 to put more people \[ in , \+ into \] the jails *T*-3 . E_S
66657:15	and she started *-1 running down there and all the hills . E_S
66703:53	and uh , \[ it 's really , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] harder * to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff , E_S
66812:33	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] they 're just going to town with them . E_S
66840:56	It 's one of these really creative houses , that I grew up in *T*-1 that nothing was on the same level with anything else *T*-2 . E_S
66930:52	I mean , it looked darker to him , because \[ he , \+ he \] was in the house with the lights on . E_S
67018:30	so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the , uh , campus to the , uh , gym , use the shower there E_S
67039:38	I 've got a touring bike . Uh , though I have n't gone on any extended trips with it . E_S
67285:28	because \[ it 's just , \+ it 's \] along the Erie Canal up here . E_S
67336:17	a person 0 *T*-1 lives across the street from me , uh , brought her home from work because a coworker of hers , uh , had this dog appear on its front doorstep , E_S
67391:25	but , uh , * managed *-1 to get him to a veterinarian in time , E_S
67395:59	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] on huge doses of antibiotics , \[ and \+ \] he actually got over it with , \[ y- , \+ \] seven hundred dollars in vet bills , E_S
67418:6	I was on a business trip at the time E_S
67456:14	I could n't even talk about it for months E_S
67556:23	but , uh , * went *-1 fishing with him on Friday and took , N_S
67629:33	but she liked *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] get in the pool on the first step . E_S
67640:22	\[ I 've , \+ I live \] right across the street from \[ a , \+ a \] big lake here , um , E_S
67817:70	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ \[ they 're , \+ they have \] \+ they 're \] working on , uh , something in Austin now , E_S
67900:30	Well , I myself would n't want *-1 to be on the jury like that . E_S
68161:41	however , I did n't like it very well when the transmission *ICH*-1 went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it *T*-2 . E_S
68216:14	And the buttons *ICH*-1 turned on it \[ ove- , \+ over \] the winter . E_S
68273:17	In fact , I 'm graduating from college in about a week E_S
68365:8	but I was out of the country at the time , E_S
68582:22	and , uh , I , uh , went to Purdue for a couple of years , E_S
68583:11	so I 've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion *-1 to visit friends E_S
68742:15	so , my father was working down in Los Angeles for like , uh , six months or so , E_S
68744:43	and , you know , \[ we 'd , \+ he 'd \] fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays , E_S
69005:6	* traveling that was in my early teens down in that area E_S
69448:69	so they have *-1 to start *-2 talking about it , or getting their act together about six months ahead * to get in touch with everybody , because they 're rather socially active too . E_S
69705:6	It goes from Winter to Summer , usually . E_S
69939:21	It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years , E_S
69940:12	because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years , E_S
70262:14	Well , I have lived in a small town for , you know , N_S
70268:19	You know , I had lived in a rural area \[ for , \+ for \] so long E_S
70373:144	The only thing that *T*-1 saves it , with the schedule 0 I work *T*-2 and the schedule 0 my wife works *T*-3 , we 're getting ready *-4 to go to work at totally different times . So that . It 's not like we 're tripping over each other in the morning . E_S
70638:41	and something will come up and wind up * having *-1 to spend a thousand dollars , you know , on the car in two months or something , E_S
70662:31	but if you do n't spend it , it should be in your bank account at the end of the month . E_S
70750:48	Well , I 'm sure that , uh , probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *T*-1 . E_S
70828:86	well , uh , I 'm , N_S what I 'm , N_S uh , I guess uh , 0 it , N_S concerned about *T*-1 , N_S * talking about the taxes in general ,
70936:6	They went from eleven to fifteen hundred , E_S
71240:8	and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs , , E_S
71539:8	I , stayed in pretty good shape during school . E_S
71663:22	\[ I , \+ I \] went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred , E_S
71950:9	women have come into the work force in the last twenty , thirty years E_S
71999:55	Um , one of the women is real active with , uh , Muscular Dystrophy . And , uh , does a lot \[ of , \+ of \] work with them on a volunteer basis E_S
72092:45	and one of the reasons , I guess 0 *T*-1 , is because there 's so much more income in the family with both parents working . E_S
72100:34	and you got twenty and thirty year olds who *T*-1 are living at home with mom and dad E_S
72179:9	I usually read that from cover to cover . E_S
72719:16	we like *-1 to keep one on hand just for emergencies , you know . E_S
72881:6	she found an ad for one *ICH*-1 in like a GOOD \[ HOU- , \+ HOUSEKEEPING \] magazine for eleven percent . E_S
72891:38	Um , years ago , well , \[ th- , \+ \] I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for , oh , probably fifteen years , E_S
73059:79	\[ It 's , \+ uh , you know , it 's \] a terrible thing 0 * to say *T*-2 when you 're speaking of children in that way *T*-1 , E_S
73134:12	and *-2 having lived in a community for a while \[ and \+ \] we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children *T*-1 . E_S
73665:6	I lived in the country for several years , E_S
73673:16	* seems like he went to school at like DeVry . E_S
73680:11	I have n't been up there in years . E_S
73686:20	but , uh , I have n't talked to him in a while , E_S
73909:73	You \[ can \+ as a teacher , ca n't \] hold a child accountable , if you 're not going *-1 to get reinforced *-2 by , that at home . E_S
73919:60	And you ca n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day , what *T*-1 's not been done *-2 for , fifteen or sixteen years at home , E_S
74218:50	* Pay attention to what *T*-1 's happening . Talk to the teachers . Uh , talk to their kids about school . And support the institution E_S
74247:10	And my mother was on the school board for eight years . E_S
74504:9	Also I lived in Georgia for about four years , E_S
74614:13	the whole bathroom is covered *-1 from ceiling to foot in tile E_S
74747:15	he says , * looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there . E_S
75254:75	I know 0 that 's \[ what , \+ uh , what \] my family was talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2 E_S
75280:33	\[ Prob- , \+ probably \] right , if you look at it from that stand point . E_S
75458:55	uh , I know 0 in my case , \[ I , \+ my wife and daughter \] were kidnapped *-1 , during a house robbery back in eighty-five E_S
75480:20	And , you know , he was out within two months because of the parole system . E_S
75706:37	When , uh , I met my husband *T*-1 , he was living in an apartment at the time E_S
75865:21	And , so my husband and I loaded bricks in his , pickup truck for days . E_S
76169:18	Uh , and you ca n't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day *-1 to counteract , uh , sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home . E_S
76188:56	and I 'm not sure just , uh , \[ how , \+ how \] the school system could operate in a vacuum on it *T*-1 . E_S
76627:22	Um , a gal who *T*-1 works , uh , with T I on this project . E_S
76766:6	We go to Tulsa from time to time . E_S
76867:35	My wife and I spent a couple years , uh , *-1 doing church work up in the state of Washington right , on the coast . E_S
77041:102	some of the people that I work with *T*-1 \[ they , \+ like when I worked on second shift *T*-2 , um , \[ their paren- , \+ their kids \] \] go to school during the day E_S
77201:6	It 's like a home away from home for a lot of them . E_S
77298:60	so , um , one of the things that we did *T*-1 with him a lot was * to go , either my husband or I , or both of us would *?* , t- , concerts with him . E_S
77659:173	Well , we had a sociologist at the center where I work *T*-2 who *T*-1 was writing a book on , uh , multigeneration , um , matriarchies , \[ in a way . \+ \] uh , where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she 's still living at home with the mother *T*-3 E_S
77733:29	Some of the stations I guess 0 *T*-1 carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there E_S
77791:19	And uh , you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N . E_S
78000:27	And then she was supposed *-1 to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday . E_S
78083:83	\[ That , \+ that \] would be \[ a , \+ to me , a \] really nice vacation because \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not in physical shape for something like that ,
78102:11	Uh , we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon , E_S
78352:32	uh , but he 's been known *-1 to be gone for a month or two at a time E_S
78375:6	we took a trip , uh , around to the , uh , Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something *T*-1 , E_S
78583:25	I ca n't even remember who *T*-1 ran for president against Bush . E_S
78599:26	There was a woman that *T*-1 was running for vice president for a while . E_S
78891:29	\[ He , \+ they \] just kind of sat him up there like a puppet E_S
79127:20	so all the monies *ICH*-3 are donated *-1 , you know , for the recycling to Children 's Hospital , which I think 0 *T*-2 is an excellent idea , there , you know , because the other , public , N_S
79193:19	you know , I 've seen a definite trend , you know , towards more recycling , everywhere , you know , even at McDonald 's , you know , with \[ their , \+ their \] use of no , foam containers anymore . E_S
79586:16	But one day I was talking to a lady about gardening E_S
79768:29	\[ If you , \+ if you \] pay for everything by cash , uh , there is a lot of things that a lot of people who *T*-2 will not give you credit when you need something like a house or , a car *T*-1 . E_S
79859:44	\[ I went an , \+ last year I went an \] was exercising on a bike for a while E_S
80477:39	and he said 0 it *ICH*-2 's a good thing 0 I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something 0 * to drink *T*-1 and went in there I would think 0 I was having hallucinations . E_S
80602:7	I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north \[ in the , \+ in the \] summertime E_S
81497:14	Well I had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . E_S
81582:28	I mean I could see people *ICH*-1 putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me , E_S
81605:47	that 's sort of what *T*-1 drove me to Denton , when I first came out here in eighty-five *T*-2 . E_S
81873:47	Well , uh , the , you know , pregnant women are n't supposed *-1 to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes . E_S
82120:7	we 're down here at the Bible belt , are n't we *?* ? E_S
82130:11	Um , I worked at T I for a while , E_S
82439:65	and so \[ that , \+ that \] got me \[ to sp- , \+ to be able *-1 to spend \] more time with the kids at night and stuff , you know , 'cause normally \[ if , \+ if \] they need something they just go to mom . No matter what it is *T*-2 , E_S
82851:16	Well , * do n't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability . E_S
82942:35	And *-1 being associated *-2 with government , he should be held *-1 up to the light for that . E_S
83047:44	But you know that just made me think of something that *T*-1 happened down here in Dallas last year . E_S
83581:124	\[ I , \+ I \] just bought it from a friend \[ who *T*-1 was going *-2 to , \+ who *T*-3 just \] charged me what the dealer was going *-4 to \[ give , \+ give \] him *T*-5 for it for a trade-in , E_S
83680:59	I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] \[ was \+ \[ pro- , \+ probably \] was \] up to your shoulder \[ in , \+ in \] thistles . E_S
83951:69	and I just threw them on the side , * intending *-1 to transplant them or throw them away or something . And forgot about them through the whole Winter . E_S
84047:104	The other thing 0 * to do *T*-1 if you , \[ re- , \+ really \] like the hyacinths , and I do , is that before you plant those bulbs , * stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so * to cool them . E_S
84093:9	It is sold *-1 down here as Purple Buddy . E_S
84201:16	You know , people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods E_S
84452:14	We , uh , went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night , *-1 driving . E_S
84740:6	we went through this with our children , and now with our grandchildren , E_S
85022:27	I do n't know if you ever got caught *-1 in a traffic jam behind a bus , E_S
85078:44	\[ Un- , \+ unfortunately \] though I think 0 the oil companies have lied to us for years . E_S
85099:18	uh , well , E_S one is already in college in New England , E_S
85151:24	Well , the greatest thing that *T*-1 happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as I 'm concerned , is the no smoking rules , on airplanes and in restaurants . E_S
85512:11	so . I stayed in a townhouse for , uh , two years and then , uh , saved up enough money * \[ to , \+ to \] get a , N_S
85619:19	the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there E_S
85736:77	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we may not have ever have seen that without some of these , uh , newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and , trying *-1 to get out of that situation . E_S
85771:2	\[ stay , \+ stay \] in line for , uh , four hours * to get an aspirin from a doctor . E_S
85902:88	Because they do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 going in \[ and , \+ and \] paying , uh , seventy-five dollars *-3 to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes . E_S
85930:105	and , uh , that 's how you come up with aspirin that *T*-1 costs four dollars apiece and things like that . The horror stories that you hear *T*-2 about people going into the hospital for a week and , uh , it being , a four thousand dollar bill *T*-3 . E_S
86033:11	and we were living in France at the time E_S
86194:24	Uh , we 're going *-1 to go for a conference in September E_S
86258:6	I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to \[ Au- , \+ Adelaide . \] E_S
86291:50	But , uh , in fact I did n't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car , E_S
86308:8	And I was by myself in China too . E_S
86341:14	and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little , Quingdao I think 0 *RNR*-1 is the name of it . E_S
86403:33	Uh , and a friend of mine who *T*-1 had gone for a business trip to China E_S
86489:9	I have lived in , uh , Illinois at one time E_S
86538:6	We lived in Tennessee for awhile E_S
86818:11	and it 's brought *-1 to us by two things . E_S
86851:16	I tend *-1 to agree with you with , you know , N_S
86884:44	\[ women are arr- , \+ young women are arrested *-1 *-4 \] fighting with knives \[ over , \+ over \] \[ whatever . \+ MUMBLEx whatever \] reason , which *T*-2 is kind of unheard of when I was young *T*-3 . E_S
86892:41	* seems that those things \[ happened befor- , \+ \] did not happen in that manner before television . E_S
87359:16	and how , I got to Texas by way , of Virginia \[ I 'm , \+ \] and everything *T*-1 is a long story . E_S
87603:58	\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ uh , and , \] uh , I know 0 I 'm \[ \[ a real , \+ \[ a \+ \] real , \] \+ \] uh , out of it in terms of taxes E_S
87622:8	and it 's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house . E_S
87650:48	uh , \[ I believe , \+ I do n't know \] which one it is *T*-1 *ICH*-3 , uh , down there whether it 's Hobby or , uh , the other ex-governor down there that *T*-2 are proposing *-4 doubling the tuition . E_S
87687:119	But all the various taxing authorities that *T*-1 come through , I think 0 the one tax 0 I resent *T*-4 the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which *T*-2 is probably never going *-3 to be in existence in my lifetime . E_S
87714:80	And , uh , for instance \[ all the , \+ all \[ the , \+ the , \] \] uh , office buildings and stuff that *T*-1 are out here \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , north Dallas as opposed to downtown , N_S
88443:13	* Go *-1 talk to Daddy about it . E_S
88450:15	* Go on and talk to Daddy about it . E_S
88750:19	actually , I mean I came straight from school to here . E_S
89209:53	Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER , E_S \[ I , \+ I \] never did care for him \[ as , \+ in \] the James Bond movies . E_S
89628:29	Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that ? E_S
89842:36	and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days . E_S
89896:56	That is an intriguing type of book 0 * to be reading *T*-1 and trying *-2 to keep up on things like that . E_S
90158:16	I think 0 I read about that in the paper . E_S
90279:35	So , because , that 's something 0 you can do *T*-1 by just enrichment types of things in the home E_S
90756:39	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ but \] we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one , in Scottsdale , Arizona , for that family . E_S
91000:19	you really have *-1 to think about that for the job . E_S
91003:11	now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs *T*-1 , E_S
91421:66	and they just went from generation , probably to generation , just \[ with these , \+ with these \] all passing it from one to the other . E_S
91518:94	Um , well , \[ where , \+ where , \] for instance , um , a Baudelaire poem that *T*-1 was written *-2 , in the French and then has been translated *-2 into English by , various people . E_S
91792:13	I have n't , talked to my brother in three years . '' E_S
91797:23	Uh , you know , my son keeps in touch with him , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
91935:11	I have n't been on vacation in a while either . E_S
91936:91	Um , usually when we go *T*-1 , we go to Colorado , to Estes Park area . Which *T*-2 is up kind of near Denver . And , uh , stay in the mountains up there , do a little hiking and resting , get away from the Texas heat , that kind of thing . E_S
91969:26	\[ We , \+ um , we \] canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River . E_S
91987:73	but we were pretty convinced 0 he was a full , hermit who *T*-1 lived up in , the woods , that he 'd come in his little log boat down the river , E_S
92031:54	the only other place 0 I 've ever vacationed *T*-1 , we 'd , you know , go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that . E_S
92132:11	Even , we traveled in Europe for about a week , E_S
92149:8	and you slept on the train at night . E_S
92360:40	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'll , \] \+ mostly I 'm \] into it for relaxation , E_S
92372:12	We generally just stay on one channel \[ all , \+ for all \] of Monday night , just *-1 to watch those . E_S
92460:96	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ wh- , \+ the \] relationship between the family \[ is , \+ is \] really \[ now , \+ now \] 0 the mother-in-law lives in the house with them . E_S
92587:8	and he walked around the house with his \[ fa- , \+ face \] down toward the floor and his mouth open , *-1 hoping 0 it would fall out , because he would n't let anybody pull it . E_S
92656:46	\[ And yet , \+ you know , and \] we were just sort of talking about it at the time . E_S
92658:12	now we 're doing it on a , city wide basis \[ in , \+ in \] communities . E_S
92959:37	I mean , like \[ I , \+ I 'd \] go \[ to the , \+ um , to the \] U T D , um , cafeteria for lunch sometimes E_S
93057:29	\[ They , \+ uh , they 've \] been in San Diego for the last few years , E_S
93095:30	\[ and , \+ and \] my husband has been hearing about these people for years E_S
93278:69	I think 0 I 'll try *-1 to stay away , except \[ my , \+ my \] second grandchild will be born *-2 \[ in \+ in \] the winter in January . E_S
93288:23	But the ordinary thing is * to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer E_S
93288:47	But the ordinary thing is * to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer E_S
93514:17	so even though I can look at it as a task , \[ the , \+ \] you know , \[ I kind of get the , \+ I get some kind of \] global benefit from the whole thing by *-1 saying , Well , I 'm lowering my chance of heart attack , and \[ thus , \+ that \] type stuff . E_S
93559:12	I 've been running since high school on track teams and the like , E_S
93592:22	but just * going *-1 to lift weights on occasion with my wife , E_S
94211:69	and there 's a place 0 \[ they , \+ they \] take the kids up to the lodge and go *-1 swimming up there in the afternoon *T*-2 , E_S
94240:21	and I think 0 we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that , E_S
94326:62	my two grandsons and one of their cousins \[ are , \+ are \] going *-1 to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know , in jeans and t-shirts and such . E_S
94407:113	to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know , because , I mean , the general values that we 're teaching *T*-1 kind of conflict with what we expect *T*-2 out of people in school , I mean , E_S
94550:13	So , I am assisting them with their children in their selections , E_S
94753:8	so he went into child care at two weeks E_S
94757:19	and , uh , my younger son went into child care at six weeks . E_S
94998:11	and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while . E_S
95068:15	but , uh , * went out of town for a while , E_S
95301:49	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 they should screen for alcohol in these areas , too because I consider that a drug . E_S
95307:38	and that , I think , is even probably more widely *ICH*-2 abused *-1 by , you know , the masses \[ than , \+ than \] drugs , so * to speak . E_S
95384:70	\[ I would , \+ I would \] rather *ICH*-2 have it that way , * to know that I was chosen *-1 at random by a computer than * to think that somebody turned me in because \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ there 's , \+ \] when you let other employees turn in people *T*-3 , N_S
95888:27	Well , I 'm going *-1 to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall . E_S
96550:17	and , Uh , have you talked with a lot of people in this project E_S
96949:33	You know , I do not remember , *-1 being involved *-2 in things like this . E_S
97157:28	Does the company 0 you work for *T*-1 have , child care on premises for , employees ? E_S
97168:47	I was , uh , a student for many years , and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile . E_S
97220:70	Well , \[ I think 0 for me , MUMBLEx the important concerns , \+ I do not think \] 0 I would put her in day care for joint , situation right now , unless it was like one other child \[ with a , \+ with a \] person . E_S
97296:18	And she 's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that . E_S
97310:17	and I will probably be going back to work around January , whereas she will be about , eight or nine months old . E_S
97408:17	And so , if I go back to work on a part time basis , I am hoping 0 I can leave my daughter with her . Because , her daughter again will be a couple of months , my daughter will be about six months older than hers *?* . E_S
97719:58	And , uh , I think 0 our problems would be fewer , if we supported each other . And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser , because we are equal . E_S
98250:32	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ we 're \] about the same in Baltimore . E_S
98472:57	\[ and , \+ and then \] later , this was actually funny , my brother and I were picked *-1 up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought \[ a , \+ a \] new car E_S
98513:23	and \[ I , \+ I \] look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense \[ of , \+ of \] the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1 , N_S
98708:21	so I 'm going *-1 to be down on the floor with them . E_S
98844:49	you do n't want *-1 to dress too tacky because you 're going *-2 to be in the same room with them . E_S
98992:6	I agree with you on , N_S
99146:11	Oh , I went from a large high school to a \[ u- , \+ large university \] E_S
99237:49	\[ so , \+ uh , But \] \[ I 've been , \+ I 've been \] in Texas for fifteen years . E_S
99282:13	and it did n't rain from August until December E_S
99382:22	and it *EXP*-1 was wonderful * being on the lake like that . E_S
99427:6	I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles \[ from , \+ from \] the city limits E_S
99475:61	my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on , you know , make a pond in the backyard for us . E_S
99557:26	even the couple of ice storms I 've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit . E_S
99912:63	Well the kids have even got to the point where \[ they , \+ if they \] see anybody going in the trash can with a can , you know , \[ they , \+ they 're , \] oh , no , * do n't do that *T*-1 E_S
99966:68	She appeared *-1 to have a couple of light strokes and started *-1 to , uh , not be able *-2 to be in her apartment on her own . E_S
99992:42	when it finally came down to it *T*-1 , um , she just got to the point after the , N_S
100229:11	and we 'll find out about it in a casual conversation . E_S
100367:16	I think 0 it 's probably more true *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 , still \[ in the , \+ in the \] smaller communities then in the larger cities . E_S
100553:8	and she taught in high school in inner city , uh , Minneapolis . E_S
100680:45	So they started , uh , *-1 dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees \[ through \+ you know , through \] all three years of middle school . E_S
100893:23	and neither one of them has ever been \[ in \+ in , \] uh , day care for the reason \[ of , \+ of \] me working E_S
100964:5	Or pay for it after school . E_S
100965:8	Our Emily 's in the third grade over at Huffman E_S
101046:39	Uh , the first one was an , elderly lady who *T*-1 was putting \[ a , \+ a \] daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money . E_S
101558:8	And you sprinkle , uh , \[ that , \+ those , \] uh , toasted onion rings . On top of it for the crunchy . E_S
101820:239	Uh , for instance , I think 0 the schools are having more and more problems because of , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening socially in the world around them and \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] t- , \+ \] because of their parents E_S and things that *T*-1 are being taught *-2 in the home are not taught *-2 in the home , rather . More not than * are *?* . And children being put *-3 in day-care centers from very early , N_S
101936:32	but , uh , I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools . E_S
101971:41	I know 0 \[ they do do some , \+ they do have some \] classes *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 in , um , high schools and things for kids 0 *T*-1 to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like *T*-2 \[ and the , \+ uh , you know , and , uh , that \] kind of thing E_S
102325:6	I went to dinner with some friends last weekend E_S
102535:18	And , uh , I 'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because , uh , we had friends that *T*-1 went *-2 to see that and said , you know , 0 it 's just perfect for our age group E_S
102671:37	Before we moved to , the area , my brother , uh , lived in Dallas for a number of years E_S
103299:38	I guess 0 it 's either , you know , * put him in jail for the rest of his life , you know , \[ or \+ or \] capital punishment I guess . You know E_S
103371:24	\[ We , \+ we 've \] had a real problem *ICH*-1 here in Texas with , uh , prison overcrowding E_S
103591:11	We all go back to parents ' houses on the weekends , and what not E_S
103596:6	I played violin in the orchestra for several years you know , E_S
103874:36	well , we keep our \[ paper , \+ paper \] bags lined *-1 up in the garage for \[ glass and , \+ glass and , \] uh , plastics E_S
103925:26	You know actually , we had milk delivered *-1 to our house in glass bottles E_S
104047:33	oh , \[ I 'm , \+ I \] generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays
104092:25	but , I think 0 I have n't been to the movie theater here in about , oh , six months , E_S
104367:18	I , uh , was n't raised *-1 as a kid on it , E_S
104416:6	They 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . E_S
104496:29	and when we buy the soda when it 's on sale for ninety-nine cents *T*-1 , E_S
104517:18	I do n't , uh , subscribe to any magazines at home , because we get so many *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 at work that , uh , I need *-1 to read *T*-2 that , uh , I just do n't take any at home . E_S
104616:44	But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what , uh , *T*-1 pertains to my daily life at the present time . E_S
104621:15	Well , since I work with computers during my work , I have *-1 to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything . E_S
104624:48	I can see that it will be a very long time , probably , before I subscribe to any magazines at home . E_S
104734:19	And , uh , * having thought about that for a while , N_S
104742:17	And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years . E_S
104994:6	I worked for a camp for a number of years . E_S
105009:28	and , uh , more than once we 'd get out there on a really stormy day E_S
105012:8	So you 're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle E_S
105028:67	but , uh , we did some water skiing *ICH*-1 , of course , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * driving around the lake in the boat
105288:45	Uh , when we normally go that way *T*-1 , we like *-2 to go to California at the same time , because we really do n't get out there as often as you could *?* probably from Texas . E_S
105722:16	I never , uh , returned to work for the p- , N_S
105803:61	I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had *-1 to go to work after my husband 's death *T*-2 . E_S
105992:54	I make it a habit of * always going out to Pasta Oggi 's which *T*-1 is right down there in Ad- , N_S
106139:36	But when it got to the point 0 I was spending more time at the hospital with her *T*-2 *T*-1 , N_S
106289:17	I had *-1 to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands * to go *-2 buy some paint thinner , \[ and MUMBLEx \+ and \] everything like that , E_S
106617:18	and we intend *-1 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably . E_S
106728:12	you kind of divide it in fourths in a way , do n't you ? E_S
106880:50	And I never worried about *-1 saving money because \[ we just , \+ we 're \] in the savings plan at work E_S
106937:29	Um , I do n't really think 0 we have anything in the works as of yet . E_S
107033:38	I remember 0 my grandparents and I used *-1 to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans . E_S
107364:19	And , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in Texas , I think 0 I would go with something very dry *-1 to keep it off , you know . E_S
107568:11	And she 's lived with us for like five years . E_S
107701:17	This country *ICH*-1 kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country . E_S
107781:6	I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family E_S
107960:19	but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly . E_S
108033:11	and I will run around to the store in things , in slacks and tennis shoes , E_S
108128:6	they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night , E_S
108345:29	\[ I , um , \+ I \] was thinking about it for a long time , E_S
108792:6	I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock
108817:14	and so I was going to school for , you know , just a few hundred dollars a semester , E_S
108892:64	but then after that , I was on my own , *-1 working and , you know , trying *-2 to go to school on my own . E_S
109146:9	so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home E_S
109980:23	but , I mean , we were going to the doctor once a week , E_S
110014:8	and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room , E_S
110170:43	I 'd noticed 0 up here they 're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper 0 *T*-1 . E_S
110309:32	as I said , if I have *-1 to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted *-2 , E_S
111012:25	\[ I 've been , \+ I was \] down in MUMBLEx for a week , E_S
111210:6	I got her for Christmas from my family , \[ and , \+ \] uh , back when we lived in Nebraska *T*-1 . E_S
111287:13	and we sort of fell in love with the , uh , Maine Coon cats . E_S
111406:24	And \[ we live- , \+ we lived \] in Ohio prior to this . E_S
111418:13	uh , but I look for service even at the quickie places type things . E_S
111517:26	McDonald 's , uh , we 've sort of been off of that for a while E_S
111588:33	He 's gone during the week and likes *-1 to eat at home on the weekends , E_S
111629:121	and , uh , I was thinking about it after I got off the phone , \[ that , \+ that \] I really , you know , wish that there was some way 0 * to , uh , send a message *ICH*-1 to people , you know , about , um , child abuse and things like that *T*-2 E_S
111896:56	\[ This is , \+ that 's \] real funny 0 you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church E_S
111985:32	\[ It 's , uh , over , \+ there 's one over \] there in Addison . E_S
112193:39	\[ The , \+ the \] older one \[ is not , \+ was not \] at all into , uh , sports for the most part . E_S
112328:11	My husband has taken us to work with him , E_S
112513:19	Um , in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months . E_S
112559:24	because \[ w- , \+ I \] live in a college town in Penn State University E_S
112592:6	Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today , E_S
112646:8	and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days . E_S
112689:28	And I basically , do n't want *-1 to go to a hot place on vacation . E_S
112713:16	Uh , I have n't been to Yellowstone for a long , long time E_S
112778:30	To me why somebody would want *-1 to ride around on a boat for a few days *T*-2 is mind boggling . E_S
112809:47	Because , you know , I think that \[ they have , \+ they have \] it all over there in just a few tiny , \[ two , \+ two \] miles . E_S
112918:11	I could n't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL , if I did n't , like football . E_S
112978:13	and when you go to a football game in Colorado *T*-1 \[ that 's , \+ you know , there 's \] snow E_S
113236:21	it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for , N_S
113369:27	I guess 0 in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things , E_S
113528:69	so , you know , unless they really make it rough on them \[ that 's not a , \+ * going to prison for a little while is not much of a \] deterrent I do n't think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
113653:34	But anyway I 'm glad *-1 to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment . E_S
113936:55	And , um , you know he , um , got a green card \[ is , \+ and is \] in good standing in America and China ,
114192:6	we get some killer winters up here in the mountains . E_S
114325:21	And , uh , I 've always lived down here in the south , E_S
114326:15	and , oh , I took my car up there to their house E_S
114495:89	and then there have been several times when I just said , well , I just really do n't have the time , you know 0 * to deal with it at that moment *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
114621:8	and I put all my personal stuff on it at work . E_S
114629:7	I worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years . Which *T*-1 was different . E_S
115401:10	and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago E_S
115453:8	Have you gone , like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts ? E_S
115655:6	We go out with friends on the , N_S
115805:11	and he just moved down here to Mc- , N_S
115864:6	I agree with you in that area . E_S
116035:17	Uh , generally we just go on family vacations to Arizona . E_S
116102:20	We 're going *-1 to go in March after my children 's birthdays and get all that business out of the way . E_S
116173:11	So do you go to school in Provo , Utah ? E_S
116360:6	I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college E_S
116435:52	and it *EXP*-1 is really frightening , uh , * to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety . E_S
116437:35	but , you know , when you ca n't even , send them on their normal activities in safety *T*-1 , \[ it , \+ it 's \] really frightening . E_S
116444:16	I mean , it 's just in so much of society with the violence E_S and the kids having access to weapons and drugs E_S
116789:16	Well , uh , we live in \[ a , \+ a \] brick home in far north Dallas E_S
116965:16	my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while . E_S
116977:16	and my daughter 's been going with the same boy for a while , E_S
117474:23	One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station E_S
117749:50	\[ and \+ and \] the last one got hit *-1 , uh , as she was following \[ my , \+ one of my sons \] across the road to the school . E_S
117794:8	and he 's in the laundry room with this little carpet square E_S
118502:9	it 's been out of hand , I think 0 *T*-1 , for a while , E_S
118511:16	I think 0 it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent E_S
118651:8	My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School . E_S
118660:13	he , um , had her in the car in front of a Taco MUMBLEx or something E_S
118693:37	Uh , I just have a feeling that we 've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know . E_S
118861:29	And , uh , uh , course I 've been working on it for five years , E_S
119230:16	You have *-1 to get back in the sticks in the , N_S
119460:30	and , without any warning whatsoever , you could be going down the freeway at sixty E_S
119567:224	but \[ I , \+ again , I \] do n't want *-1 to see us pour \[ a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a , \+ uh , well , uh , a whole lot under any circumstances \] because \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it 's worth more *ICH*-2 to them than if you give it to them , E_S
119740:7	* Stay in touch with it and \[ know , \+ feel like I know \] what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
119813:15	they 've just been so terribly mistreated *-1 for so \[ many , \+ many \] years , you know . I mean , through Papa Doc , E_S
120068:31	I have a huge collection of dolls which *T*-1 is still in New Mexico with my parents . E_S
120170:28	So \[ you , \+ you \] have n't been back to Europe since then , huh ? E_S
120584:28	\[ I , \+ if I \] can get on Central from anywhere , I 'm happy . E_S
120705:18	and they said 0 they turn into black bugs in the spring E_S
121025:11	Well , I work for the state \[ as , \+ as \] a grounds keeper . E_S
121055:105	I was even planning *-1 to go out and to , uh , dig up some hibiscus plants that *T*-2 will not make it through the winter here , but , you know , were planted *-3 in the ground since last spring E_S
121104:11	When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter *T*-1 , you know , \[ and \+ \] their grass is fairly green . E_S
121142:11	and we were taking care of lawns out there , E_S
121473:8	and we went to the Officers ' Club for a little Mexican food E_S today .
121595:93	I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits , and kind of \[ southern , \+ uh , southern \] food even though I 'm up here in New York , E_S
121828:28	But there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years . E_S
121875:123	Um , huh . Well , I do n't like it when , uh , people listen to my phone conversations , like if they 're outside my door while I 'm talking in my room *T*-1 , or when people like look through my things in my bedroom *T*-2 . E_S
121925:29	\[ Are you stil- , \+ do you \] live at home with your parents ? E_S
122007:8	this lady does that to me at work when I 'm taking an order or something *T*-1 , E_S
122062:63	and you would like *-1 to , feel like it 's an invasion of privacy because you ca n't even ride down the road without people all the way around you , you know . E_S
122099:42	because \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] remember *-2 waking up in several years at night when I 'd hear a fire truck go by *T*-1 , you know . E_S
122424:24	\[ We , \+ we 've \] talked some about it in my state because we 've had a lot of , uh , prob- , N_S
122494:21	\[ I , \+ I \] worked on a golf course \[ at , \+ at \] one time E_S
122528:6	It 's probably up there to twenty now if I MUMBLEx \[ * to \+ \] start again . E_S
122831:27	I think , uh , 0 it *EXP*-3 's in everyone 's nature to some degree * to want *-1 to get out and explore something 0 they have n't *?* *T*-2 , or experience something , you know , indifferent . E_S
123364:12	I have n't been up there since , oh , Lord , forty-eight , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
123448:19	I mean , that 's occurred *-1 certainly at times in the past , E_S
123664:9	so I 'm more *ICH*-1 into college football than professional , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
124146:58	So if you hang onto your clothes long enough , uh \[ they 'll , \+ they 'll \] be back in style in a few years . E_S
124210:16	I just , uh , moved down from South Dakota in July , E_S
124235:69	my son E_S and I used *-1 to have a bet *ICH*-3 going about some of the players that *T*-2 had moved from here to Minnesota , E_S
124380:35	Um , factories \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 burn coal as \[ a , \+ an \] energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , E_S
124506:6	Probably blowing up there to you guys . E_S
124586:49	and it said that , uh , like thirty-four percent of , uh , college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program . E_S
124641:26	\[ and , \+ or \] if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . E_S
124641:78	\[ and , \+ or \] if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . E_S
124896:11	but they eventually gets up there to five thousand , ten thousand , whatever fifty thousand E_S
125518:93	\[ \[ \[ Some , \+ some places , um , start them as early as , I think , \] \+ well , some , \] \+ some places \] take them as infants , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , like eight weeks , even . E_S
125602:9	We 're getting up in age , I guess , in our late thirties E_S
125740:65	And , you know , when you work nine to five , or eight to five *T*-1 , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately *T*-1 . E_S
125773:24	you know , when they 're trying *-1 to get rid *-2 of those cars at the end of the year like that *T*-3 , they really come down on their prices E_S
126067:35	Um , my sense is that something may just have been done *-1 about it by congressmen MUMBLEx E_S
126344:76	I have a girlfriend that every time 0 her son starts *-1 taking things for granted *T*-2 *T*-3 she threatens *-4 to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while . E_S
126421:13	Well , my husband works at T I over on Central . E_S
126727:12	I have been working \[ at , \+ uh , as \] an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas E_S
127190:6	I 'm a night operator here at a industry down here E_S
127211:9	and I go to school during the day and work at night . E_S
127687:54	Well , I watch more now because , well \[ I , \+ I \] had been going to school for years and have really been too busy E_S
128162:13	and I do n't take it on trips with me . E_S
128326:30	Uh , that 's advice that I will need *T*-1 in time future for my children , rather than one that I have , uh , personal experience with *T*-2 . E_S
128408:51	or it 's a lot cheaper *ICH*-1 if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school , uh , E_S
128643:48	It was like , uh , * want an autograph , * want *-1 to stand in line for about four hours . E_S
128862:8	but they 're at home at night , E_S
128924:12	because I have lived in Utah for like ten years . E_S
128942:6	It 's more humid *ICH*-1 in Utah than there ? E_S
128948:6	It 's more humid *ICH*-1 in Iowa than Utah . E_S
129321:9	I was interviewed *-2 by four attorneys for about five hours . E_S
129476:8	And I visited the prison up here \[ and , \+ \] at Parchman E_S
129744:64	Although \[ just , \+ just \] about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that , uh , *T*-1 work in the library for me said 0 they had n't gotten theirs . E_S
129821:45	because \[ they charge you , \+ * let 's see , they charge you \] for your garbage pick up by the weight . E_S
129870:32	kind of a pain * to , you know , drive over somewhere special \[ just for that , \+ for two \] little tiny batteries E_S
130036:75	Except that , I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] average cost \[ to si- , \+ to society \] of * having somebody in jail for all their life \[ is , \+ is \] extremely high . I mean , something , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] was amazed at *T*-1 . Uh , uh , per year , E_S
130302:16	or , do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything ? E_S
130605:8	Do you go to museums in Europe ? E_S
130614:8	and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany . E_S
130815:25	But , uh , I know 0 we had a problem down here with , uh , \[ oil , \+ people taking oil \] out of their cars and just putting it down \[ \[ the d- , \+ you know , the s- , \] \+ the drain sewer . \] E_S
130993:14	Well , we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas . E_S
131272:62	I 'm sure , 0 in Dallas since you 're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their P C 's or with their lap computers or whatever . E_S
131491:82	J R , \[ \[ \[ my , \+ my , \] \+ my \] last son \+ or my middle son , \] * excuse me , fell in love with Washington state E_S
131498:44	and \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] third daughter fell in love with , uh , uh , Vermont . E_S
131604:46	We do n't go out *-1 drinking beer till three and try *-1 to go to class in the morning . E_S
131780:85	and , course , * believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the , uh , third course , my score has gone from , you know , a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five . E_S
132080:24	Like \[ I , \+ I \] traded my , uh , three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred . E_S
132122:32	I was amazed 0 I was able *-1 to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in , E_S
132257:45	but there was a , deal where a doctor was going *-1 to be sued *-2 for malpractice on the death on an infant *T*-3 . E_S
132316:15	And , uh , we do , uh , aerobics , for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes E_S
132374:8	and I am at school at seven thirty . E_S
132716:145	and then you just dip the carcass in , uh , boiling water , pull it out , and \[ there 's a , \+ we use a \] little raspy brush , 0 *T*-1 pulls the hair off , and , uh , gut it , and , uh , just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and , uh , some pineapple , about three pineapples , you know , * sliced them up , and , uh , cover him up with , uh , wet , uh , sacks , feed sacks is what I usually use *T*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him . E_S
132831:6	there 's nothing *ICH*-1 between you and us but our barb wire ,
133249:55	I 'd say , first of all , 0 they need *-1 to go back to *-2 spending more time on the basic reading , writing , arithmetic in grade school , E_S
133389:63	So , uh , I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a start at least , * going back to the basics in the early grades E_S
133399:8	Did you go to school in Plano ? E_S
133487:6	I talked to my kids about it , you know E_S
133981:22	And , uh , I , um , went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability , E_S
133996:23	It *EXP*-2 's going *-1 to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three , * to account for that . E_S
134148:28	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] * having precious cargo in the car with me , as you can well imagine , it *EXP*-3 's very hard for me to imagine \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , a Honda 's going *-1 to be as safe a car \[ as , \+ as \] the one that I 've got my eye on *T*-2 , which *T*-4 is a Volvo . E_S
134209:8	so there 're lots and lots of them available in the paper at \[ any , \+ any \] week , E_S
134362:10	or does it come mostly from industry up there ? E_S
134396:9	I 'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas , E_S
134642:36	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] worked on some of it at T I once upon a time . E_S
134849:35	I think 0 we went through him though *-1 to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects E_S
135077:9	I 've got one , two , three , four , five , six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet . E_S
135530:37	Well , * to tell you the truth , I 've been going to college for the last four years E_S
135697:9	because they go from hardback to paperback E_S
135882:22	This is much better than * dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime . E_S
135896:11	Well , we moved actually down here from another location , E_S
136025:8	but that was very unseasonable for us down here . E_S
136223:16	well , they 're not entertained *-1 for too long with it . E_S
136676:14	so I really do spend probably more time *ICH*-1 with him \[ than , \+ than \] most , you know . E_S
136763:25	\[ We have , \+ we often go \] to Illinois for Christmas , E_S
136813:27	\[ And , \+ um , so \] he worked on that for the longest time , ever since school was out on Friday , E_S
136906:28	\[ we 've , \+ I 've \] been all over the states except for pretty much east . E_S
136907:11	Um , it 's very pretty driving like , um , up north in Wisconsin too . E_S
137073:6	I lived in Indiana for a while , E_S
137160:8	So she was n't in it for very long before she was out of it , E_S
137411:11	Uh , I went to California up to the Sequoias . E_S
137511:25	I do n't know why I got stuck *-1 down here in Texas now *T*-2 . E_S
137566:11	well , you went out from Texas up \[ in , \+ into \] that area ? E_S
137571:9	and we stopped at , uh , uh , Las Vegas for a couple of nights , and then , uh , went into Malibu in California over on the coast . E_S
137575:12	And then we went up \[ the , \+ the \] Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco . \[ And , uh , \+ and \] then cut across through the wine country . And then went down \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , Sequoia National Park . E_S
137945:15	But , uh , I got down here in June of eighty-four , E_S
138067:33	so \[ he 's , \+ he \] has been going to private since kindergarten . E_S
138288:26	Uh , well , I like *-1 to think of it as a hobby ,
138716:87	But I have been in a situation *ICH*-2 , uh , recently where I was laid *-1 off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year *T*-3 E_S
138871:8	and they talk about it \[ \[ as a , \+ you know , as , \] \+ as \] better for the country and better for the working conditions . E_S
138885:18	but I guess 0 you 're always on call for it . E_S
138912:40	and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that , uh , going through it in a day
138943:15	then he 's been working for the company for a while , too . E_S
139121:31	and so I wind up *-1 going out *-2 camping with , uh , a bunch of boys at one time E_S
139243:11	You do n't think about that as \[ a career , \+ a normal career , \] uh , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
139303:19	* Think 0 we 're going in just a couple of weeks out to \[ the , \+ east \] Texas , E_S
139309:96	the only thing 0 you have *-1 to watch out *T*-2 in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that *T*-3 occasionally come through out here on the plains . E_S
139338:67	Uh , as I understand it , and I , uh , do n't know a lot about it , uh , we got in there because of France E_S
139387:17	* Wonder what *T*-1 happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something . E_S
140202:22	and , he said , I 'll sell that snake to you for two fifty . E_S
140327:35	\[ what \+ what \] do you like *-1 to do *T*-2 for yourself in car automobile repairs ? E_S
140546:9	We 've lived in ours for about six years . E_S
141047:8	and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer . E_S
141164:53	So what do you feel 0 *T*-1 are the current trends in the way 0 families spend time in general , you know , in America *T*-2 ? E_S
141550:40	Well , our boys , \[ one , is , \+ uh , he is \] in graduate school at A and M ,
141597:24	I do n't know if you have gotten into that with your kids , E_S
141906:118	But most of \[ the ti- , \+ the times \] I find that even if \[ there are , \+ you know , they do have \] like tremors out there , you know , there 'll be a small article *ICH*-1 in the paper about it . E_S
141926:33	\[ That 's , \+ um , that 's \] been like that since \[ they , \+ \] the first newspaper , you know . E_S
142044:23	It *EXP*-1 's hard * to talk for five minutes on this . E_S
142180:54	Well , you need *-1 to , uh , teach them how * to play *T*-2 and take them out on the course with you . E_S
142372:31	and then we would go to work and uh , come back to the , uh , you know , boat house at night E_S
142448:16	So , we have been roughing it out here for about three years , E_S
143041:6	I lived in France for a year and a half E_S
143063:23	and \[ I , \+ I \] lived in the Alps in France E_S
143085:98	\[ So , \+ um , and \] \[ you always have *-1 to go out , fly through , \+ or unless you fly from Nairobi , you have *-2 to fly through , \] um , uh , Europe on your way home . E_S
143228:49	like , would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place , or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week ? E_S
143305:49	Um , but I 've always thought 0 it *EXP*-1 would be neat * to go on a safari over there . E_S
143350:11	And we 've lived in two houses in Richardson . E_S
143506:35	I had a young lady 0 *T*-1 used *-2 to work for me at my office from the high school E_S
143569:24	and we just moved down *-1 to be on staff down here E_S
143583:11	When we moved from Louisiana to Denver *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 was astounding , you know , * to find that prices were , oh , I guess almost two or three times as high as we 'd expected *?* . E_S
143645:40	And there are , uh , some fairly sophisticated approaches that *T*-1 are used *-2 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people , uh , gain a competence with respect to the material . E_S
143766:35	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] watched my grandmother go into debt on them E_S
143903:6	I worked \[ w- , \+ \] at Sears for over ten years E_S
144230:8	and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens E_S
144298:51	\[ \[ It 's , \+ you know , it 's , \] \+ it 's \] about the \[ same , \+ uh , same \] distance *ICH*-1 from here \[ to s- , \+ to San \] Antonio as it is *?* from there to Sacramento . E_S
144298:128	\[ \[ It 's , \+ you know , it 's , \] \+ it 's \] about the \[ same , \+ uh , same \] distance *ICH*-1 from here \[ to s- , \+ to San \] Antonio as it is *?* from there to Sacramento . E_S
144382:11	And I 've worked in the hospital for fifteen years E_S
144671:49	And , yet , I know 0 \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] sounds like big money to me . E_S
144698:20	Did you have any fear *-1 working in the hospital with that , E_S
144738:15	and then the other one was on the roof in the back . E_S
144758:36	so I got \[ a g- , \+ my gun \] and walked \[ to the , \+ you know , through the house into the \] garage . E_S
144876:8	and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System . E_S
144904:33	There are marvelous B M W -s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked * all up and down the street outside these awful taverns . E_S
144920:24	I do n't think 0 I 'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself MUMBLEx . E_S
145163:30	uh , are you going *-1 to , uh , put your son in child care in \[ a , \+ a \] year or two ? E_S
145181:11	Uh , I get out of class at certain time E_S
145353:11	uh , I got in some \[ problems with , \+ uh , financial problems because of \] credit cards E_S
145470:31	I mean , well , I mean , you have sort of a discipline *ICH*-1 in general about finances , E_S
145538:82	\[ I , \+ in fact , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] \] even , uh , heard some people that *T*-1 have applied for credit cards with much less , uh rates and have paid off their , you know higher interest rate , uh cards and just sent them back , you know . E_S
145588:54	and he 's just told them , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] can get this card from this bank at this rate E_S
145628:33	and \[ we were f- , \+ we were \] living in Utah at the time . E_S
145767:6	I 'm over here in Plano , Texas . E_S
146060:24	I did n't know 0 anyone ever moved from California to \[ Kan- , \+ Iowa ? \] E_S
146063:11	and then I went to school in Utah , E_S
146081:63	\[ Do you , \+ um , do you \] have any hobbies \[ that , \+ that \] you do things *ICH*-1 with your hands like knitting or *T*-2 , N_S
146302:8	and they 're , you know , already out with number six by now , E_S
146312:36	\[ They 're , \+ uh , they 're \] getting rid *-1 of the old cast for the movies , though . E_S
146779:11	Now , I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters . E_S
147043:46	And so the way 0 I dress *T*-1 is really different because I 'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months . E_S
147111:31	I just know that , um , acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from , \[ would \+ \] N_S
147112:6	* comes over the border from us . E_S
147350:38	\[ I , \+ I \] know a lady that *T*-1 lives in a place similar to that in Austin . E_S
147454:9	so she lived by herself up until she was ninety , ninety-one . And just did everything , E_S
147583:47	And it *EXP*-1 's just too bad that some people , you know , still look down on them just because of their color . You know . E_S
147644:41	\[ I , \+ I \] see more men , uh , like participating in like the family things with children . Like , you know , helping * to take care of them more . \[ And \+ and , \] uh , uh , doing the jobs equally , you know , E_S
147752:24	How many do you think 0 *T*-1 are in there for \[ pub- , \+ for bu- , \] N_S
148091:36	I \[ almost , \+ uh , almost , \] uh , bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago *T*-1 . E_S
148436:23	but , you know , jazz can get on my nerves after a while . E_S
148438:14	you just ca n't listen to it for enjoyment \[ unless you 're . \+ Yeah , \[ unless , \+ unless \] you 're \] playing it , E_S
149294:6	They range from twenty-four to five . E_S
149342:20	we do n't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday E_S
149377:11	and it does begin with the families at home E_S
149388:11	Well , we see that a lot out here in Utah , E_S
149394:13	Um , do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas , E_S
149655:16	I think 0 it 's in New York City \[ at the , \+ at the \] Gardens E_S
150002:35	I 'd say 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably in the \[ top , \+ top \] ten in terms of crime . E_S
150020:53	and \[ \[ you can just , \+ you can just , \] \+ as you walk through the street on a given evening , you can \] see crimes being committed *-1 . E_S
150080:31	and kind of a couple of people , they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off , so I did n't know who *T*-1 had it . E_S
150333:11	and then we do electrical tests on them during the process , E_S
150411:69	and , um , I was *?* because \[ my , \+ my \] same doctor , you know , agreed *-1 to be in it for , uh , N_S
150424:22	Uh , if you 've been going to a doctor for , you know , ten years or something and he elects *-1 not to join , it can be very stressful for you know , those people . E_S
150744:13	they recommend * doing the video without weights for the first month E_S
150955:28	\[ they 're , \+ they 're \] stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over , E_S
150976:34	if you wanted *-1 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it E_S
151061:23	Well , you learn a lot *-1 going to the juries like that though . E_S
151198:8	and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks E_S
151409:8	and you work in the office around . E_S
151552:20	Well , uh , I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except \[ \[ in , \+ in \[ specific , \+ uh , very specific \] \] \+ in this , uh , very specific \] examples such as , uh , transportation workers , as in , uh , air traffic controllers , bus drivers and that kind of thing . E_S
152012:67	That 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios *T*-2 \[ as the , \+ as the \] air is heated *-1 , you know , by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio E_S
152058:30	and so we canoe down the river and then , sleep on the river on one of the , um , sand bars and then get up the next morning , cook our breakfast , and go down the river again . E_S
152086:21	and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week , E_S
152360:38	and I know 0 historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical E_S
152629:14	Uh , I would feel more comfortable *ICH*-1 in many cases I think 0 *T*-2 with judges . Uh , you know , doing the sentencing . E_S
152955:48	\[ You 're like , \+ you 're like \] my daughter who *T*-1 is in college down in Massachusetts E_S
153033:38	\[ they 're , \+ * looks like they 're \] going more *ICH*-1 for ratings than for you know actual news . E_S
153088:14	you know we were on the scene with our team players E_S
153350:6	there is a place out here , uh , called * Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville E_S
153400:16	I mean , It varies from State to State . E_S
153470:33	I mean I think 0 we have been like ranked *-1 in one of the top three for murders in the last few years . E_S
153510:44	Well , Well , now when I first moved to Dallas *T*-1 , I moved up here by myself E_S
153647:30	I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up . E_S
153692:93	but \[ you try * to , \+ you try *-1 to \] schedule those things so that , uh , \[ you only , \+ you 're not \] paying for two \[ of \+ \] at the same time I guess 0 *-3 is what I am saying *T*-2 . E_S
153838:11	but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year E_S
153860:23	Uh , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] in , uh , program control for a company up here . E_S
153980:63	You know , it 's like what *ICH*-3 can you do *T*-1 with that , that you ca n't do *T*-2 in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve . E_S
154045:6	I am just up here for the year E_S
154097:25	\[ I 've had , \+ I had \] access *ICH*-1 in the past to , uh , uh , the A P news wire E_S
154243:17	and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest E_S
154642:10	Cause they are on up there in age , are n't they *?* ? E_S
154738:44	and , uh , they had basically decided that there is going *-1 to be a real problem *ICH*-2 here within a few years on solid waste . E_S
154796:16	and he was kind of hired *-1 to do a study by two departments for the government . E_S
155280:16	and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point E_S
155401:72	and then I \[ do n't , \+ usually do n't \] exceed that \[ unless I , \+ unless the VISA bill \] gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if I have car expenses E_S
155556:8	So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that *T*-1 will eventually die E_S
155641:46	if my parents were *-1 to get ill , I would like *-2 to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help . E_S
155706:15	but , uh , she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years E_S
155897:9	like they send me to conferences for instance , but probably not as much as I 'd like *?* E_S
155952:11	but they 've been in office since \[ the , \+ the \] nineteen forties E_S
156149:12	They 're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California . E_S
156211:20	I guess 0 the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles E_S
156280:8	And there 's not that much in terms \[ of , \+ of \] public transportation down there . E_S
156301:46	but \[ I do n't , \+ uh , I do n't , \] uh , subscribe to cable \[ be- , \+ because \] of the poor service and also , uh , because , N_S
156371:20	Uh , and I like *-1 listening to that \[ on , \+ on , \] uh , N_S
156379:81	instead of *-3 being , as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb *T*-2 , they go really in depth on topics which I think 0 *T*-1 is good . E_S
156462:26	but anyway , uh , well , I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff \[ for , \+ for \] my wife and for me E_S
156851:6	I 'm for it \[ in \+ in \] some cases . E_S
156883:16	And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it , you know . E_S
157050:92	I think 0 I 've seen some statistics that *T*-1 say that , uh , it *EXP*-2 's more expensive *ICH*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life . E_S
157078:10	by * putting him in prison for life , there is still a possibility that he will get out again . E_S
157088:49	\[ but , \+ but \] the other side to that is , 0 if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , \[ or , \+ \] you know , and somehow redeem himself . E_S
157503:65	My parents , I guess 0 *T*-1 , \[ \[ h- , \+ h- , \] \+ however , \] have contributed to that , you know , for the education side of it and everything , E_S
157673:74	and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire *ICH*-1 of people *-2 to get out of there and not be stuck *-2 in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . E_S
158101:46	so , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ MUMBLEx I \] talk to parents about this a lot . E_S
158193:16	We used *-1 to live up in Seattle for a couple of years . E_S
158214:12	Of the statements made * by people against \[ the , \+ the \] death penalty , um , \[ I , \+ I \] like the statement made * by Cuomo *T*-1 . E_S
158232:241	And I think that the people who *T*-1 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . E_S Uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a \[ knife , \+ life \] type logic or just , uh , uh , some sort of anger at * \[ putting peop- , \+ putting , uh , murderers \] up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill . E_S
158236:34	I think 0 people \[ are , \+ are \] working at that from more of \[ a , \+ uh , a \] gut reaction than \[ a , \+ a \] reason humane one . E_S
158277:91	I would think 0 you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than , you know , *-1 telling them that \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] protestors out here at the , you know . N_S
158309:20	And there 's been a lot made * in the local papers of that , fact . E_S
158369:40	\[ I have n't talked to , \+ uh , I have n't talked to \] a whole lot of black people on it E_S
158517:19	and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other . You know , E_S
158878:24	and \[ I d- , \+ I work \] as a co-op at , uh , Georgia Tech Research Institute . E_S
158899:28	or \[ are you , \+ did you \] go directly from high school \[ into , \+ into \] college ? E_S
159252:54	See \[ around , \+ around \] here it 's like , uh , N_S we pretty much work from project to project \[ on , \+ well , you know , with \] different sponsors . E_S
159274:99	Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what , um , \[ the going , \+ you know , if you will *?* the going , \] uh , award should be *T*-1 for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . E_S
159394:14	And then they are awarding a second amount *ICH*-2 as punishment to the company which *T*-1 is \[ a l- , \+ usually a lot \] less . E_S
159477:8	And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died . E_S
159490:106	And , you know , it *EXP*-1 was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she \[ was , \+ uh , you know , could \] not do very much for herself after the stroke . E_S
159559:55	You need *-1 to have twenty-four hour care uh , answering all the needs cause they ca n't do much for themselves at certain points . E_S
159608:39	Uh , you know , * to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland E_S
159784:53	So , \[ \[ you , \+ you were out of s- , \] \+ you went to school \] for awhile and quit . Then went back . E_S
160040:49	and , uh I \[ had , \+ wound up *-2 having \] *-3 to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because \[ of , \+ \] you know , \[ no , \+ no \] insurance policy happened *-1 to cover it , which *T*-4 is , N_S
160149:6	She 's actually at Bible College for this current year . E_S
160251:20	I suppose 0 if you 're actually at Georgia Tech as a student , you 're a ways away from that . E_S
161076:14	and he 's been transferred *-1 to Germany for a while E_S
161295:21	I mean , these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret . E_S
161314:47	Well , \[ the \+ the \] people that *T*-1 owned him should have been on the lookout for that . E_S
161414:21	But then they have *-1 to work from age thirty \[ or , \+ or \] forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety . E_S
161422:51	well , you know , \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] world is changing \[ \[ f- , \+ uh , from instit- , \] \+ from , uh , industrial , \] uh , base to , uh , information base E_S
161435:23	So I think 0 a person could work , uh , into the seventies , eighties , even nineties for that matter , E_S
161616:6	I was kind of into it for a while there . E_S
161788:47	I used *-1 to , uh , kind of be that way myself when I lived in , uh , north western Florida in the panhandle *T*-2 , E_S
161919:12	how do you like it down there in Texas *T*-1 ? E_S
162102:122	I mean , I ca n't help but wonder \[ if , \+ if \] I grew up without a father , on the streets , and with like little or no money , \[ would n't \+ would n't \] I be in prison at this point ? E_S
162423:9	I 've been with them for seven years . E_S
162494:18	Well , I , uh , work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory . E_S
162517:60	Uh , the law firms in this town are not , you know , N_S for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties E_S
162564:28	because I have a cousin whose husband *T*-1 works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area . E_S
162958:21	and she 's able *-1 to take her baby to work with her . E_S
163121:14	uh , actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years , E_S
163525:9	they do test for drugs in that capacity , E_S
163598:41	\[ they 're , \+ they should \] be able *-1 to make it as a continue of employment in some sense E_S
163624:6	You go in there with the doctor , E_S
163719:15	and , uh , I lived in Massachusetts for a while E_S
163734:6	they were in very good financials at first E_S
163754:17	I know what *T*-1 's hot down here with me , E_S
164041:9	and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it . E_S
164114:60	and the first thing 0 they said *T*-3 is , uh , you must do n't have *-1 to be to work at eight , you know , E_S
164362:21	\[ They , \+ they \] have that down here in Florida still . E_S
164550:24	I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes , E_S
164719:22	\[ We read , \+ I read \] it pretty much from cover to cover . E_S
164884:60	I think 0 a lot of it is just , uh , the fact that in the U S you 're so far removed *ICH*-1 , uh , in a lot of cases from , say , conflicts E_S
165042:9	You can go to north Tyler to the schools E_S
165066:52	\[ I mean , \+ I mean , \] \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] up there at my kids ' school , E_S
165149:14	and it was probably made *-1 in China by slaves . E_S
165174:9	I was reading something in , uh , CONSUMER REPORTS *ICH*-1 tonight about that as a matter of fact . E_S
165305:43	but , uh uh , I really \[ do n't , \+ do n't \] do much with it at home E_S
165419:8	so I drove on those brake pads for , uh , you know , forty-five thousand miles E_S
165607:36	And \[ we , \+ you know , we 've \] experimented \[ with , \+ with , \] uh , budgets , you know from time to time , uh , E_S
165652:8	But he was with another company before that , E_S
166011:23	Well that 's more than we have *?* up here in Massachusetts . E_S
166084:18	the local schools , you could send your phone book \[ to your , \+ uh , \[ to , \+ with \] your \] kid to school E_S
166311:32	they *ICH*-1 're all three social issues and could be addressed *-2 by the government in any ways . And clearly , to me , is a kind of government thing 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] fix *T*-3 E_S
166458:6	It 's too much running for me \[ in , \+ in \] college football . E_S
166731:91	Well , uh , one of the things \[ that , \+ uh , that \] I found *T*-1 to be , uh , an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card *T*-2 and they ask me *-3 to put my telephone number \[ on the , \+ on the , \] uh , credit card bill *T*-2 . E_S
166934:29	They generally were able *-1 to have someone care for them at home E_S
166949:73	And a level four type of care would be someone that *T*-1 really requires long-term hospital care . Generally are not able *-2 to look after \[ this- , \+ themselves \] \[ to very , \+ to a very \] great extent , physically . E_S
167140:41	Uh , it 's because \[ I , \+ I \] ca n't find the item that I want *T*-1 at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . E_S
167141:8	So I go outside the area for that . E_S
167149:182	\[ \[ W- , \+ w- , \] \+ \[ fr- , \+ from \] what \] I understand *T*-3 from \[ \[ v- , \+ v- , \] \+ various \] net readings , \[ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it , \] \+ the Federal government \] is going *-1 to try *-2 to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes , uh , \[ in , \+ into \] place in the next few years . E_S
167465:8	And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something . E_S
167709:36	we just averaged out how much *ICH*-3 last year we used *T*-1 per month on medical and how much we used *T*-2 on dental E_S
167762:50	Uh , you know , there are certain months of the year that you 'll spend more *ICH*-1 on food than other months *T*-3 . And certain times when that will be left *-2 over *T*-4 . E_S
167815:23	And , uh , I ca n't really talk too much about the problems with , uh , public education in detail because the school system 0 I went to *T*-1 was , uh , really superb even though it was a public school system . E_S
167834:28	I want *-1 to \[ as- , \+ talk \] to you about that afterward , E_S
168113:89	and I can drive to work \[ in , \+ \] uh *ICH*-2 , and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor . Which *T*-1 goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges . E_S
168135:14	Well , they just kicked it off down here \[ in , \+ in \] Sarasota county . E_S
168422:11	Oh , you moved from Dallas to San Francisco . E_S
168460:12	* never have worried about money since then . E_S
168529:36	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 I 'm in the , uh , majority \[ of , \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] Texas E_S
168597:8	and I lived out in Texas for a little while E_S
169098:9	And I went to college for four years and got out , you know , E_S
169174:43	I mean \[ I wo n't even , \+ I wo n't \] go to the grocery store at night . E_S
169425:46	and anything 0 I participated in *T*-1 or know about *T*-1 when I read about it in the paper *T*-2 is always \[ so , \+ \] uh , covered *-3 from such a funny and superficial perspective that I do n't have much confidence in it . E_S
169602:12	does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather \[ than , \+ than \] the judge ? E_S
169769:6	I sat for \[ tw- , \+ ten \] days in a court room while they went through the selection process , E_S
169851:55	and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . E_S
170007:134	but again , um , it must be depressing for the people \[ \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 are , \+ who *T*-2 are \] just \[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ essentially \] not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house \[ but , \+ but , \] \[ certainly , \+ uh , certainly \] \[ \[ \[ \[ have \+ ar- , \] \+ ar- , \] \+ are , \] \+ have \] retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on . E_S
170072:8	and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation *T*-1 . E_S
170139:106	The best program 0 we ever had *T*-1 is at the beginning of the month we \[ took and , \+ uh , took \] my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope E_S
170389:61	and , you know , there are reason 0 * to look for another job instead of * just dumping it on them all at one time *T*-1 . E_S
170498:22	My next oldest daughter that *T*-1 's in college in California is a world twirling champion . E_S
171010:45	Of course , you also tend *-1 to get people that *T*-2 are associated *-3 with the university and the hospital as the parents , E_S
171059:47	and \[ even , \+ even \] though my wife was n't working , we did have , uh , one or another of the boys in , uh , child care \[ for part-ti- , \+ just for part \] of the day . Uh , or a couple of days a week just so that , uh , other things could get done *-1 around the house and so on , E_S
171113:31	but I have n't really had a chance * to talk to her about that for a while . E_S
171181:65	And now it 's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute . Because you can get it there , you know \[ in , \+ in \] a matter of minutes you know , through a fax machine *T*-1 E_S
171195:22	Because you 're expected *-1 to work on stuff up until the last minute . E_S
171202:11	and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes E_S
171392:111	but \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4 . E_S
171499:11	and she was sitting in school on a carpet E_S
171662:41	So , uh , right now , \[ we 're on , \+ we get \] \[ f- , \+ you know , aid from \] the state at this point because there 's no other way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
172234:8	But I am in favor of it for criminal cases E_S
172320:32	uh , but lot of times so difficult * to get on them at school . E_S
172348:30	so . \[ Have you , \+ do you \] have a computer for yourself at home ? E_S
172448:18	and the kids , they just take to it like candy . E_S
172487:34	Uh , I love the irony of , uh , * talking about this subject on April the , fifteenth . E_S
172534:30	Well and I still think that , * having lived in Europe for awhile , you know , difference in living conditions are certainly well worth , uh , what we pay *T*-1 for it . E_S
172543:6	I was in Germany , you know , for several years E_S
172574:31	I wish 0 I did n't have *-1 to pay any more *ICH*-3 \[ fo- , \+ to \] my physicians in a year than I had *-2 to pay for all of my school taxes . E_S
172843:86	\[ And , \+ uh , and so \] \[ as , \+ as \] a result , uh , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a trade-off , you know , for the common good , you know . \[ For , \+ for \] the benefit of others , you know . E_S
173189:30	I have one colleague that , uh , *T*-1 commutes to work on one when it 's not raining *T*-2 E_S
173479:20	and \[ I , \+ I 'm \] with you on that . E_S
173563:6	We have them at one school like , E_S
173632:163	So , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I mean \] \[ as , \+ as \] man has gotten more complicated so all of the , uh , imaginations * to , uh , you know , protect him \[ from , \+ from \] *-1 being , uh , dumped *-2 on by , uh , civilian authority \[ \[ in , \+ in so- , \] \+ in criminal actions , \] especially , you know , murder cases and that sort of thing . E_S
173636:138	Um , for instance , um there 's a case *ICH*-2 a few years back where , uh , \[ someone , \+ uh , someone \] who *T*-3 's \[ \[ being convicted * for , \+ was under a tri- , \] \+ was going to trial for \] murder , was let *-1 off because of a technicality in that . \[ The of- , \+ the arresting officer , \] uh , did not read the defendant their rights *T*-4 . E_S
173682:35	Uh , one is that , uh , if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it 's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability * to function , then \[ I , \+ I \] think \[ that , \+ that , \] you know , I do n't have any problem at all with * testing that individual , you know , on the spot . E_S
173822:41	So you 're saying that the taxpayer who *T*-1 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes E_S
173822:102	So you 're saying that the taxpayer who *T*-1 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes E_S
173942:28	But whether it was * going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever , telling them stories or reading to them . E_S
174106:14	In fact , they were all in , uh , over the weekend for Easter . E_S
174113:78	but if you have a problem with what we did *T*-1 or how we did it *T*-2 , you can always come back and talk to me about it . E_S
174616:11	Well , I 'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes . E_S
174791:36	this was in conjunction with the guy that *T*-1 was put *-2 in the gas chamber in California . E_S
175006:22	and we both had *-1 to go through drug testing at the same time . E_S
175025:39	I mean , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] have gone to a couple of parties \[ since , \+ since \] that time E_S
175378:26	and \[ if , \+ \] they should pay for it with their life . E_S
175519:23	and \[ I , \+ I \] worked in the same lab with a guy E_S
175532:79	Uh , \[ we 're having a , \+ for all unclassified programs , \[ we 're , \+ we 're \] having \] little tables put *-1 up in front of MUMBLEx lab in the hallways E_S
175785:30	And I was thinking in the course of * talking to him about it , how , uh , in World War Two , the personalties of Stalin , Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war *T*-1 E_S
176021:9	I 'm going over \[ to , \+ to \] Britain \[ in mid , \+ you know , in mid-May . \] E_S
176202:109	I really \[ am , \+ \[ a- , \+ \] am \] concerned \[ about is \+ \] that , uh , so many of these child care places \[ are , \+ are \] coming under , uh , uh , you know , investigation \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , you know , child molestation . E_S
